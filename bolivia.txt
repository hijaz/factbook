{"south america":{"bolivia":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR, broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history has consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and countercoups. Democratic civilian rule was established in 1982, but leaders have faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and illegal drug production. In December 2005, Bolivians elected Movement Toward Socialism leader Evo MORALES president - by the widest margin of any leader since the restoration of civilian rule in 1982 - after he ran on a promise to change the country's traditional political class and empower the nation's poor, indigenous majority. However, since taking office, his controversial strategies have exacerbated racial and economic tensions between the Amerindian populations of the Andean west and the non-indigenous communities of the eastern lowlands. In December 2009, President MORALES easily won reelection, and his party took control of the legislative branch of the government, which will allow him to continue his process of change. In October 2011, the country held its first judicial elections to appoint judges to the four highest courts."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Central South America, southwest of Brazil"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"17 00 S, 65 00 W"},"map references":{"value":"South America"},"area":{"value":"total: 1,098,581 sq km country comparison to the world: 28 land: 1,083,301 sq km water: 15,280 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly less than three times the size of Montana"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 6,940 km border countries: Argentina 832 km, Brazil 3,423 km, Chile 860 km, Paraguay 750 km, Peru 1,075 km"},"coastline":{"value":"0 km (landlocked)"},"maritime claims":{"value":"none (landlocked)"},"climate":{"value":"varies with altitude; humid and tropical to cold and semiarid"},"terrain":{"value":"rugged Andes Mountains with a highland plateau (Altiplano), hills, lowland plains of the Amazon Basin"},"elevation extremes":{"value":"lowest point: Rio Paraguay 90 m highest point: Nevado Sajama 6,542 m"},"natural resources":{"value":"tin, natural gas, petroleum, zinc, tungsten, antimony, silver, iron, lead, gold, timber, hydropower"},"land use":{"value":"arable land: 3.49% permanent crops: 0.2% other: 96.31% (2011)"},"irrigated land":{"value":"1,282 sq km (2003)"},"total renewable water resources":{"value":"622.5 cu km (2011)"},"freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"value":"total: 2.64 cu km/yr (25%/14%/61%) per capita: 305.8 cu m/yr (2005)"},"natural hazards":{"value":"flooding in the northeast (March to April) volcanism: volcanic activity in Andes Mountains on the border with Chile; historically active volcanoes in this region are Irruputuncu (elev. 5,163 m), which last erupted in 1995, and Olca-Paruma"},"environment - current issues":{"value":"the clearing of land for agricultural purposes and the international demand for tropical timber are contributing to deforestation; soil erosion from overgrazing and poor cultivation methods (including slash-and-burn agriculture); desertification; loss of biodiversity; industrial pollution of water supplies used for drinking and irrigation"},"environment - international agreements":{"value":"party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands signed, but not ratified: Environmental Modification, Marine Life Conservation"},"geography - note":{"value":"landlocked; shares control of Lago Titicaca, world's highest navigable lake (elevation 3,805 m), with Peru"}},"people and society":{"nationality":{"value":"noun: Bolivian(s) adjective: Bolivian"},"ethnic groups":{"value":"Quechua 30%, mestizo (mixed white and Amerindian ancestry) 30%, Aymara 25%, white 15%"},"languages":{"value":"Spanish (official) 60.7%, Quechua (official) 21.2%, Aymara (official) 14.6%, foreign languages 2.4%, other 1.2% (2001 census)"},"religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 95%, Protestant (Evangelical Methodist) 5%"},"demographic profile":{"value":"Bolivia ranks at or near the bottom among Latin American countries in several areas of health and development, including poverty, education, fertility, malnutrition, mortality, and life expectancy.

Bolivia's income inequality is the highest in Latin America and one of the highest in the world. Public education is of poor quality, and educational opportunities are among the most unevenly distributed in Latin America, with girls and indigenous and rural children less likely to be literate or to complete primary school. The lack of access to education and family planning services helps to sustain Bolivia's high fertility rate - approximately three children per woman. Bolivia's lack of clean water and basic sanitation, especially in rural areas, contributes to health problems. Almost 7% of Bolivia's population lives abroad, primarily to work in Argentina, Brazil, Spain, and the United States.

In 2005, the government passed a controversial hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange for a predetermined service fee. The global recession slowed growth, but Bolivia recorded the highest growth rate in South America during 2009. During 2010-12 high world commodity prices sustained rapid growth and large trade surpluses.
