The manufacturing and financial sectors account for more than half of San Marino's GDP. The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy. The economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings. The income tax rate is also very low, about one-third the average EU level. San Marino does not issue public debt securities; when necessary, it finances deficits by drawing down central bank deposits. San Marino''s economy has encountered five years of GDP contraction, largely due to weakened demand from Italy - which accounts for 90% of its export market - and financial sector consolidation. Difficulties in the banking sector, the recent global economic downturn, and the sizeable decline in tax revenues have contributed to negative real GDP growth. The government has adopted measures to counter the economic downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses. For the first time since 2009, there were signs of improvements in the financial sector in the third quarter of 2012. San Marino continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU and international standards. In September 2009, the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully adopt global tax standards, and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries. San Marino's Government continues to work with Italy to ratify a financial information exchange agreement, seen by businesses and investors as crucial to strengthening the economic relationship between the two countries."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$1.371 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 199 $1.429 billion (2011 est.) $1.465 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$1.855 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"-4% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 216 -2.5% (2011 est.) -7.5% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$36,200 (2009) country comparison to the world: 228 $41,900 (2007)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 0.1% industry: 39.2% services: 60.7% (2009)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"wheat, grapes, corn, olives;
