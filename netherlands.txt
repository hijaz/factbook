After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed in 1815. In 1830 Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, but suffered invasion and occupation by Germany in World War II. A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member of NATO and the EEC (now the EU) and participated in the introduction of the euro in 1999. In October 2010, the former Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands - Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities in the Netherlands administrative structure.

Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002. After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the Dutch economy - highly dependent on an international financial sector and international trade - contracted by 3.5% in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis. The Dutch financial sector suffered, due in part to the high exposure of some Dutch banks to U.S. mortgage-backed securities. In 2008, the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars of capital into other financial institutions, to prevent further deterioration of a crucial sector. The government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs, offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers, and expanding export credit facilities. The stimulus programs and bank bailouts, however, resulted in a government budget deficit of 5.3% of GDP in 2010 that contrasted sharply with a surplus of 0.7% in 2008. The government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE began implementing fiscal consolidation measures in early 2011, mainly reductions in expenditures, which resulted in an improved budget deficit in 2011. In 2012 tax revenues dropped nearly 9%, GDP contracted, and the budget deficit deteriorated. Although jobless claims continued to grow, the unemployment rate remained relatively low at 6.8 percent."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$718.6 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 24 $725 billion (2011 est.) $717.9 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$773.1 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"-0.9% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 198 1% (2011 est.) 1.6% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$42,900 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 22 $43,400 (2011 est.) $43,200 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"27.5% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 34 28.3% of GDP (2011 est.) 25.6% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 45.6% government consumption: 28.4% investment in fixed capital: 17% investment in inventories: 0.5% exports of goods and services: 88% imports of goods and services: -79.6% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 2.5% industry: 24.9% services: 72.6% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"grains, potatoes, sugar beets, fruits, vegetables;
