{"europe":{"cyprus":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960 following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot-occupied area declared itself the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" (\"TRNC\"), but it is recognized only by Turkey. The election of a new Cypriot president in 2008 served as the impetus for the UN to encourage both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to reopen unification negotiations. In September 2008, the leaders of the two communities began discussions under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island. The talks are ongoing. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the internationally recognized government, and is suspended in the areas administered by Turkish Cypriots. However, individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of European Union states."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Middle East, island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"35 00 N, 33 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 9,251 sq km (of which 3,355 sq km are in north Cyprus) country comparison to the world: 171 land: 9,241 sq km water: 10 sq km"},"area -

Tourism, financial services, and real estate are the most important sectors. Erratic growth rates over the past decade reflect the economy's reliance on tourism, the profitability of which can fluctuate with political instability in the region and economic conditions in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the economy in the area under government control has grown at a rate well above the EU average since 2000. Cyprus joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM2) in May 2005 and adopted the euro as its national currency on 1 January 2008. An aggressive austerity program in the preceding years, aimed at paving the way for the euro, helped turn a soaring fiscal deficit (6.3% in 2003) into a surplus of 1.2% in 2008, and reduced inflation to 4.7%. This prosperity came under pressure in 2009, as construction and tourism slowed in the face of reduced foreign demand triggered by the ongoing global financial crisis. Although Cyprus lagged behind its EU peers in showing signs of stress from the global crisis, the economy tipped into recession in 2009, contracting by 1.7%, and has been slow to bounce back since, posting anemic growth in 2010-11 before contracting again by 2.3% in 2012. Serious problems surfaced in the Cypriot financial sector in early 2011 as the Greek fiscal crisis and euro zone debt crisis deepened. Cyprus's borrowing costs have risen steadily because of its exposure to Greek debt. Two of Cyprus's biggest banks are among the largest holders of Greek bonds in Europe and have a substantial presence in Greece through bank branches and subsidiaries. Cyprus experienced numerous downgrades of its credit rating in 2012 and has been cut off from international money markets. The Cypriot economy contracted in 2012 following the writedown of Greek bonds. A liquidity squeeze is choking the financial sector and the real economy as many global investors are uncertain the Cypriot economy can weather the EU crisis. The budget deficit rose to 7.4% of GDP in 2011, a violation of the EU's budget deficit criteria - no more than 3% of GDP. In response to the country's deteriorating finances and serious risk of contagion from the Greek debt crisis, Nicosia implemented measures to cut the cost of the state payroll, curb tax evasion, and revamp social benefits, and trimmed the deficit to 4.2% of GDP in 2012. In July, Nicosia became the fifth euro zone government to request an economic bailout program from the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund - known collectively as the \"Troika\". Negotiations over the final details of the plan are ongoing."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$24 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 125 $24.6 billion (2011 est.) $24.47 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$23.01 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"-2.4% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 211 0.5% (2011 est.) 1.3% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$27,500 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 57 $28,500 (2011 est.) $29,100 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"6.6% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 137 14.2% of GDP (2011 est.) 9.8% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 66.8% government consumption: 20.1% investment in fixed capital: 12.8% investment in inventories: 0.3% exports of goods and services: 45.5% imports of goods and services: -45.4% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 2.3% industry: 15.4% services: 82.3% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"citrus, vegetables, barley, grapes, olives, vegetables;
