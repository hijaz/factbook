{"europe":{"liechtenstein":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic Wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money laundering. However, Liechtenstein implemented anti-money laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US that went into effect in 2003."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Central Europe, between Austria and Switzerland"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"47 16 N, 9 32 E"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 160 sq km country comparison to the world: 219 land: 160 sq km water: 0 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"about 0.9 times the size of Washington, DC"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 76 km border countries: Austria 34.9 km, Switzerland 41.1 km"},"coastline":{"value":"0 km (doubly landlocked)"},"maritime claims":{"value":"none (landlocked)"},"climate":{"value":"continental;

The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein providing 30% of state revenues. The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the EU) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. Since 2008, Liechtenstein has faced renewed international pressure - particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its banking and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein's conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD in October 2009 removed the principality from its \"grey list\" of countries that had yet to implement the organization's Model Tax Convention. By the end of 2010, Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange Agreements or Double Tax Agreements. In 2011 Liechtenstein joined the Schengen area, which allows passport-free travel across 26 European countries."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$3.2 billion (2009) country comparison to the world: 178 $3.216 billion (2008) $3.159 billion (2007)"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$5.113 billion (2010)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"-0.5% (2009 est.) country comparison to the world: 186 1.8% (2008 est.) 3.1% (2007 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$89,400 (2009 est.) country comparison to the world: 2 $90,600 (2008 est.) $89,700 (2007 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 8% industry: 37% services: 55% (2009)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"wheat, barley, corn, potatoes; livestock, dairy products"},"industries":{"value":"electronics, metal manufacturing, dental products, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, food products, precision instruments, tourism, optical instruments"},"industrial production growth rate":{"value":"NA%"},"labor force":{"value":"35,250 (2012) country comparison to the world: 202 note: 51% of the labor force in Liechtenstein commuted daily from Austria, Switzerland, or Germany (2012)"},"labor force - by occupation":{"value":"agriculture: 0.8% industry: 39.4% services: 59.9% (2010)"},"unemployment rate":{"value":"2.5% (2011) country comparison to the world: 18 2.2% (2010)"},"population below poverty line":{"value":"NA%"},"household income or consumption by percentage share":{"value":"lowest 10%: NA% highest 10%: NA%"},"budget":{"value":"revenues: $1.29 billion expenditures: $1.372 billion (2011 est.)"},"taxes and other revenues":{"value":"25.2% of GDP (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 124"},"budget surplus (+) or deficit (-)":{"value":"-1.6% of GDP (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 76"},"fiscal year":{"value":"calendar year"},"inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"value":"0.2% (2011) country comparison to the world: 5 0.7% (2010)"},"market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"exports":{"value":"$3.76 billion (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 123 $3.191 billion (2010 est.) note: trade data exclude trade with Switzerland"},"exports - commodities":{"value":"small specialty machinery, connectors for audio and video, parts for motor vehicles, dental products, hardware, prepared foodstuffs, electronic equipment, optical products"},"imports":{"value":"$2.218 billion (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 159 $1.806 billion (2010 est.) note: trade data exclude trade with Switzerland"},"imports - commodities":{"value":"agricultural products, raw materials, energy products, machinery, metal goods, textiles, foodstuffs, motor vehicles"},"debt - external":{"value":"$0 (2001) country comparison to the world: 205"},"exchange rates":{"value":"Swiss francs (CHF) per US dollar - 0.94 (2012) 0.89 (2011) 1.04 (2010) 1.09 (2009) 1.08 (2008)"}},"communications":{"telephones - main lines in use":{"value":"20,000 (2012) country comparison to the world: 185"},"telephones - mobile cellular":{"value":"38,000 (2012) country comparison to the world: 204"},"telephone system":{"value":"general assessment: automatic telephone system domestic: fixed-line and mobile-cellular services widely available; combined telephone service subscribership exceeds 150 per 100 persons international: country code - 423; linked to Swiss networks by cable and microwave radio relay (2011)"},"broadcast media":{"value":"relies on foreign terrestrial and satellite broadcasters for most broadcast media services; first Liechtenstein-based TV station established August 2008; Radio Liechtenstein operates multiple radio stations; a Swiss-based broadcaster operates several radio stations in Liechtenstein (2008)"},"internet country code":{"value":".li"},"internet hosts":{"value":"14,278 (2012) country comparison to the world: 128"},"internet users":{"value":"23,000 (2009) country comparison to the world: 190"}},"transportation":{"pipelines":{"value":"gas 20 km (2013)"},"railways":{"value":"total: 9 km country comparison to the world: 134 standard gauge: 9 km 1.435-m gauge (electrified) note: belongs to the Austrian Railway System connecting Austria and Switzerland (2008)"},"roadways":{"value":"total: 380 km country comparison to the world: 201 paved: 380 km (2012)"},"waterways":{"value":"28 km (2010) country comparison to the world: 106"}},"military":{"military branches":{"value":"no regular military forces; National Police maintains close relations with neighboring forces (2013)"},"manpower available for military service":{"value":"males age 16-49: 8,009 (2010 est.)"},"manpower fit for military service":{"value":"males age 16-49: 6,538 females age 16-49: 6,746 (2010 est.)"},"manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"value":"male: 219 female: 211 (2010 est.)"},"military - note":{"value":"Liechtenstein has no military forces, but the modern National Police maintains close relations with neighboring forces.
