With the abolition of African slavery in 1863, workers were brought in from India and Java. Independence from the Netherlands was granted in 1975. Five years later the civilian government was replaced by a military regime that soon declared a socialist republic. It continued to exert control through a succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In 1990, the military overthrew the civilian leadership, but a democratically elected government - a four-party coalition - returned to power in 1991. The coalition expanded to eight parties in 2005 and ruled until August 2010, when voters returned former military leader Desire BOUTERSE and his opposition coalition to power."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Northern South America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between French Guiana and Guyana"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"4 00 N, 56 00 W"},"map references":{"value":"South America"},"area":{"value":"total: 163,820 sq km country comparison to the world: 92 land: 156,000 sq km water: 7,820 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly larger than Georgia"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 1,703 km border countries: Brazil 593 km, French Guiana 510 km, Guyana 600 km"},"coastline":{"value":"386 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm exclusive economic zone: 200 nm"},"climate":{"value":"tropical; moderated by trade winds"},"terrain":{"value":"mostly rolling hills; narrow coastal plain with swamps"},"elevation extremes":{"value":"lowest point: unnamed location in the coastal plain -2 m highest point: Juliana Top 1,230 m"},"natural resources":{"value":"timber, hydropower, fish, kaolin, shrimp, bauxite, gold, and small amounts of nickel, copper, platinum, iron ore"},"land use":{"value":"arable land: 0.36% permanent crops: 0.04% other: 99.6% (2011)"},"irrigated land":{"value":"511.8 sq km (2003)"},"total renewable water resources":{"value":"122 cu km (2011)"},"freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"value":"total: 0.67 cu km/yr (6%/4%/90%) per capita: 1,396 cu m/yr (2006)"},"natural hazards":{"value":"NA"},"environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation as timber is cut for export; pollution of inland waterways by small-scale mining activities"},"environment - international agreements":{"value":"party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements"},"geography - note":{"value":"smallest independent country on South American continent; mostly tropical rain forest; great diversity of flora and fauna that, for the most part, is increasingly threatened by new development; relatively small population, mostly along the coast"}},"people and society":{"nationality":{"value":"noun: Surinamer(s) adjective: Surinamese"},"ethnic groups":{"value":"Hindustani (also known locally as \"East Indians\"; their ancestors emigrated from northern India in the latter part of the 19th century) 37%, Creole (mixed white and black) 31%, Javanese 15%, \"Maroons\" (their African ancestors were brought to the country in the 17th and 18th centuries as slaves and escaped to the interior) 10%, Amerindian 2%, Chinese 2%, white 1%, other 2%"},"languages":{"value":"Dutch (official), English (widely spoken), Sranang Tongo (Surinamese, sometimes called Taki-Taki, is native language of Creoles and much of the younger population and is lingua franca among others), Caribbean Hindustani (a dialect of Hindi), Javanese"},"religions":{"value":"Hindu 27.4%, Protestant 25.2% (predominantly Moravian), Roman Catholic 22.8%, Muslim 19.6%, indigenous beliefs 5%"},"demographic profile":{"value":"Suriname is a pluralistic society consisting primarily of Creoles (persons of mixed African and European heritage), the descendants of escaped African slaves known as Maroons, and the descendants of Indian and Javanese contract workers. The country overall is in full, post-industrial demographic transition, with a low fertility rate, a moderate mortality rate, and a rising life expectancy. However, the Maroon population of the rural interior lags behind because of lower educational attainment and contraceptive use, higher malnutrition, and significantly less access to electricity, potable water, sanitation, infrastructure, and health care. Some 350,000 people of Surinamese descent live in the Netherlands, Suriname's former colonial ruler. In the 19th century, better-educated, largely Dutch-speaking Surinamese began emigrating to the Netherlands. World War II interrupted the outflow, but it resumed after the war when Dutch labor demands grew - emigrants included all segments of the Creole population. Suriname still is strongly influenced by the Netherlands because most Surinamese have relatives living there and it is the largest supplier of development aid. Other emigration destinations include French Guiana and the United States. Suriname's immigration rules are flexible, and the country is easy to enter illegally because rainforests obscure its borders. Since the mid-1980s, Brazilians have settled in Suriname's capital, Paramaribo, or eastern Suriname, where they mine gold. This immigration is likely to slowly re-orient Suriname toward its Latin American roots."},"population":{"value":"566,846 (July 2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 171"},"age structure":{"value":"0-14 years: 26.8% (male 77,404/female 74,477) 15-24 years: 17.5% (male 50,745/female 48,718) 25-54 years: 43.8% (male 126,399/female 121,930) 55-64 years: 6.2% (male 17,123/female 18,246) 65 years and over: 5.6% (male 13,770/female 18,034) (2013 est.) population pyramid:"},"dependency ratios":{"value":"total dependency ratio: 51.6 % youth dependency ratio: 41.5 % elderly dependency ratio: 10.1 % potential support ratio: 9.9 (2013)"},"median age":{"value":"total: 28.2 years male: 27.8 years female: 28.5 years (2013 est.)"},"population growth rate":{"value":"1.15% (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 103"},"birth rate":{"value":"17.1 births/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 116"},"death rate":{"value":"6.15 deaths/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 161"},"net migration rate":{"value":"0.57 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 65"},"urbanization":{"value":"urban population: 69% of total population (2010) rate of urbanization: 1.5% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"major urban areas - population":{"value":"PARAMARIBO (capital) 259,000 (2009)"},"sex ratio":{"value":"at birth: 1.05 male(s)/female 0-14 years: 1.04 male(s)/female 15-24 years: 1.04 male(s)/female 25-54 years: 1.04 male(s)/female 55-64 years: 0.93 male(s)/female 65 years and over: 0.77 male(s)/female total population: 1.01 male(s)/female (2013 est.)"},"maternal mortality rate":{"value":"130 deaths/100,000 live births (2010) country comparison to the world: 64"},"infant mortality rate":{"value":"total: 27.99 deaths/1,000 live births country comparison to the world: 69 male: 32.54 deaths/1,000 live births female: 23.21 deaths/1,000 live births (2013 est.)"},"life expectancy at birth":{"value":"total population: 71.41 years country comparison to the world: 145 male: 69.05 years female: 73.88 years (2013 est.)"},"total fertility rate":{"value":"2.04 children born/woman (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 123"},"contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"45.6% (2006)"},"health expenditures":{"value":"5.3% of GDP (2011) country comparison to the world: 134"},"physicians density":{"value":"0.911 physicians/1,000 population (2004)"},"hospital bed density":{"value":"3.1 beds/1,000 population (2010)"},"drinking water source":{"value":"improved: urban: 97% of population rural: 81% of population total: 92% of population unimproved: urban: 3% of population rural: 19% of population total: 8% of population (2010 est.)"},"sanitation facility access":{"value":"improved: urban: 90% of population rural: 66% of population total: 83% of population unimproved: urban: 10% of population rural: 34% of population total: 17% of population (2010 est.)"},"hiv/aids - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"1% (2009 est.) country comparison to the world: 49"},"hiv/aids - people living with hiv/aids":{"value":"3,700 (2009 est.) country comparison to the world: 123"},"hiv/aids - deaths":{"value":"fewer than 200 (2009 est.) country comparison to the world: 112"},"major infectious diseases":{"value":"degree of risk: very high food or waterborne diseases: bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever vectorborne disease: dengue fever and malaria (2013)"},"obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"25.1% (2008) country comparison to the world: 60"},"children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"7.5% (2006) country comparison to the world: 74"},"education expenditures":{"value":"NA"},"literacy":{"value":"definition: age 15 and over can read and write total population: 94.7% male: 95.4% female: 94% (2010 est.)"},"school life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"value":"total: 12 years (2002)"},"child labor - children ages 5-14":{"value":"total number: 6,094 percentage: 6 % (2006 est.)"},"unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"value":"total: 21.5% (2004) country comparison to the world: 53"}},"government":{"country name":{"value":"conventional long form: Republic of Suriname conventional short form: Suriname local long form: Republiek Suriname local short form: Suriname former: Netherlands Guiana, Dutch Guiana"},"government type":{"value":"constitutional democracy"},"capital":{"value":"name: Paramaribo geographic coordinates: 5 50 N, 55 10 W time difference: UTC-3 (2 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)"},"administrative divisions":{"value":"10 districts (distrikten, singular - distrikt);

Trade picked up, boosting Suriname's economic growth about 4% per year in 2010-12, but the government's budget remained strained. Inflation rose from 1.3% in 2009 to 17.7% in 2011. In January 2011, the government devalued the currency by 20% and raised taxes to reduce the budget deficit. As a result of these measures, inflation receded to 6% in 2012.
