It won its complete independence in 1917. During World War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory. In the subsequent half century, the Finns made a remarkable transformation from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy; per capita income is now among the highest in Western Europe. A member of the European Union since 1995, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation in January 1999. In the 21st century, the key features of Finland's modern welfare state are a high standard of education, equality promotion, and national social security system - currently challenged by an aging population and the fluctuations of an export-driven economy."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Northern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Bothnia, and Gulf of Finland, between Sweden and Russia"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"64 00 N, 26 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 338,145 sq km country comparison to the world: 65 land: 303,815 sq km water: 34,330 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than Montana"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 2,654 km border countries: Norway 727 km, Sweden 614 km, Russia 1,313 km"},"coastline":{"value":"1,250 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm (in the Gulf of Finland - 3 nm) contiguous zone: 24 nm exclusive fishing zone: 12 nm;

Trade is important with exports accounting for over one third of GDP in recent years. Finland is strongly competitive in manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Finland excels in high-tech exports such as mobile phones. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population. Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU in recent years and its banks and financial markets avoided the worst of global financial crisis. However, the world slowdown hit exports and domestic demand hard in 2009, with Finland experiencing one of the deepest contractions in the euro zone. A recovery of exports, domestic trade, and household consumption stimulated economic growth in 2010-11. The recession affected general government finances and the debt ratio, turning previously strong budget surpluses into deficits, but Finland has taken action to ensure it will meet EU deficit targets by 2013 and retains its triple-A credit rating. Finland's main challenge in 2013 will be to stimulate growth in the face of weak demand in EU export markets and government austerity measures meant to reduce its budget deficit. Longer-term, Finland must address a rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity that threaten competitiveness, fiscal sustainability, and economic growth."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$200.7 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 55 $201.1 billion (2011 est.) $195.7 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$250.1 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"-0.2% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 190 2.8% (2011 est.) 3.3% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$37,000 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 37 $37,200 (2011 est.) $36,400 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"19.6% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 77 21.2% of GDP (2011 est.) 22% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 56.4% government consumption: 25.1% investment in fixed capital: 19.6% investment in inventories: 1.4% exports of goods and services: 40.5% imports of goods and services: -43.1% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 2.8% industry: 25.9% services: 71.2% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"barley, wheat, sugar beets, potatoes;
