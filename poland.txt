{"europe":{"poland":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Poland's history as a state begins near the middle of the 10th century. By the mid-16th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ruled a vast tract of land in central and eastern Europe. During the 18th century, internal disorders weakened the nation, and in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \"Solidarity\" that over time became a political force with over ten million members. Free elections in 1989 and 1990 won Solidarity control of the parliament and the presidency, bringing the communist era to a close. A \"shock therapy\" program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. With its transformation to a democratic, market-oriented country largely completed, Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Central Europe, east of Germany"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"52 00 N, 20 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 312,685 sq km country comparison to the world: 70 land: 304,255 sq km water: 8,430 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than New Mexico"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 3,047 km border countries: Belarus 605 km, Czech Republic 615 km, Germany 456 km, Lithuania 91 km, Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast) 432 km, Slovakia 420 km, Ukraine 428 km"},"coastline":{"value":"440 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm exclusive economic zone: defined by international treaties"},"climate":{"value":"temperate with cold, cloudy, moderately severe winters with frequent precipitation;

The government of Prime Minister Donald TUSK steered the Polish economy through the economic downturn by skillfully managing public finances without stifling economic growth and adopted controversial pension and tax reforms to further shore up public finances. While the Polish economy has performed well over the past five years, growth slowed in 2012, in part due to the ongoing economic difficulties in the euro zone. The key policy challenge is to provide support to the economy through monetary easing, while maintaining the pace of structural fiscal consolidation. Poland's economic performance could improve over the longer term if the country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and rail infrastructure and its business environment. An inefficient commercial court system, a rigid labor code, red tape, and a burdensome tax system keep the private sector from realizing its full potential."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$814.1 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 22 $797.8 billion (2011 est.) $764.7 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$487.7 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
