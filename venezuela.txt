For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959. Hugo CHAVEZ, president from 1999 to 2013, sought to implement his \"21st Century Socialism,\" which purported to alleviate social ills while at the same time attacking capitalist globalization and existing democratic institutions. Current concerns include: a weakening of democratic institutions, political polarization, a politicized military, rampant violent crime, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are endangering the rain forest and indigenous peoples."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Northern South America, bordering the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, between Colombia and Guyana"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"8 00 N, 66 00 W"},"map references":{"value":"South America"},"area":{"value":"total: 912,050 sq km country comparison to the world: 33 land: 882,050 sq km water: 30,000 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly more than twice the size of California"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 4,993 km border countries: Brazil 2,200 km, Colombia 2,050 km, Guyana 743 km"},"coastline":{"value":"2,800 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm contiguous zone: 15 nm exclusive economic zone: 200 nm continental shelf: 200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"climate":{"value":"tropical; hot, humid; more moderate in highlands"},"terrain":{"value":"Andes Mountains and Maracaibo Lowlands in northwest; central plains (llanos); Guiana Highlands in southeast"},"elevation extremes":{"value":"lowest point: Caribbean Sea 0 m highest point: Pico Bolivar 5,007 m"},"natural resources":{"value":"petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, gold, bauxite, other minerals, hydropower, diamonds"},"land use":{"value":"arable land: 2.85% permanent crops: 0.71% other: 96.44% (2011)"},"irrigated land":{"value":"10,550 sq km (2008)"},"total renewable water resources":{"value":"1,233 cu km (2011)"},"freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"value":"total: 9.06 cu km/yr (23%/4%/74%) per capita: 358.6 cu m/yr (2008)"},"natural hazards":{"value":"subject to floods, rockslides, mudslides; periodic droughts"},"environment - current issues":{"value":"sewage pollution of Lago de Valencia; oil and urban pollution of Lago de Maracaibo; deforestation; soil degradation; urban and industrial pollution, especially along the Caribbean coast; threat to the rainforest ecosystem from irresponsible mining operations"},"environment - international agreements":{"value":"party to: Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands signed but not ratified:: none of the selected agreements"},"geography - note":{"value":"on major sea and air routes linking North and South America; Angel Falls in the Guiana Highlands is the world's highest waterfall"}},"people and society":{"nationality":{"value":"noun: Venezuelan(s) adjective: Venezuelan"},"ethnic groups":{"value":"Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Arab, German, African, indigenous people"},"languages":{"value":"Spanish (official), numerous indigenous dialects"},"religions":{"value":"nominally Roman Catholic 96%, Protestant 2%, other 2%"},"demographic profile":{"value":"Although poverty in Venezuela has declined during the CHAVEZ administration, dropping from nearly 50% in 1999 to about 27% in 2011, it remains high and some experts question how much of a role social expenditures have played in this poverty reduction. Progress in lowering poverty, income inequality, and unemployment may in fact be more closely linked to the rise and fall of prices for oil, Venezuela's dominant export. In the long-run, education and healthcare spending may increase economic growth and reduce income inequality, but rising costs and the staffing of new healthcare jobs with foreigners are slowing development. In the meantime, social investment has led to better living standards, including increased school enrollment, a substantial reduction in infant and child mortality, and greater access to potable water and sanitation. Since CHAVEZ came to power in 1999, more than a million predominantly middle- and upper-class Venezuelans are estimated to have emigrated. The brain drain is attributed to a repressive political system, lack of economic opportunities, steep inflation, a high crime rate, and corruption. Thousands of oil engineers emigrated to Canada, Colombia, and the United States following CHAVEZ's firing of over 20,000 employees of the state-owned petroleum company during a 2002-2003 oil strike. Additionally, thousands of Venezuelans of European descent have taken up residence in their ancestral homelands. Nevertheless, Venezuela continues to attract immigrants from South America and southern Europe because of its lenient migration policy and the availability of education and healthcare. Venezuela also has been a fairly accommodating host to more than 200,000 Colombian refugees."},"population":{"value":"28,459,085 (July 2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 46"},"age structure":{"value":"0-14 years: 28.6% (male 4,144,958/female 3,989,521) 15-24 years: 18.8% (male 2,686,366/female 2,664,062) 25-54 years: 39.5% (male 5,520,689/female 5,727,432) 55-64 years: 7.3% (male 993,176/female 1,094,586) 65 years and over: 5.8% (male 722,234/female 916,061) (2013 est.) population pyramid:"},"dependency ratios":{"value":"total dependency ratio: 53.2 % youth dependency ratio: 43.7 % elderly dependency ratio: 9.5 % potential support ratio: 10.6 (2013)"},"median age":{"value":"total: 26.6 years male: 25.9 years female: 27.3 years (2013 est.)"},"population growth rate":{"value":"1.44% (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 84"},"birth rate":{"value":"19.66 births/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 89"},"death rate":{"value":"5.23 deaths/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 182"},"net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 106"},"urbanization":{"value":"urban population: 93% of total population (2010) rate of urbanization: 1.7% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"major urban areas - population":{"value":"CARACAS (capital) 3.051 million;

Fueled by high oil prices, record government spending helped to boost GDP growth by 4.2% in 2011, after a sharp drop in oil prices caused an economic contraction in 2009-10. Government spending, minimum wage hikes, and improved access to domestic credit created an increase in consumption which combined with supply problems to cause higher inflation - roughly 26% in 2011 and 21% in 2012. President Hugo CHAVEZ's efforts to increase the government's control of the economy by nationalizing firms in the agribusiness, financial, construction, oil, and steel sectors have hurt the private investment environment, reduced productive capacity, and slowed non-petroleum exports. In the first half of 2010 Venezuela faced the prospect of lengthy nationwide blackouts when its main hydroelectric power plant - which provides more than 35% of the country's electricity - nearly shut down. In May 2010, CHAVEZ closed the unofficial foreign exchange market - the \"parallel market\" - in an effort to stem inflation and slow the currency's depreciation. In June 2010, the government created the \"Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities\" to replace the \"parallel\" market. In December 2010, CHAVEZ eliminated the dual exchange rate system and unified the exchange rate at 4.3 bolivars per dollar. In January 2011, CHAVEZ announced the second devaluation of the bolivar within twelve months. In December 2010, the National Assembly passed a package of five organic laws designed to complete the transformation of the Venezuelan economy in line with CHAVEZ's vision of 21st century socialism. In 2012, Venezuela continued to wrestle with a housing crisis, high inflation, an electricity crisis, and rolling food and goods shortages - all of which were fallout from the government's unorthodox economic policies. The budget deficit for the entire government reached 17% of GDP in 2012, and public debt as a percent of GDP climbed steeply to 49%, despite record oil prices."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$408.5 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 34 $387.1 billion (2011 est.) $371.5 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$382.4 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
