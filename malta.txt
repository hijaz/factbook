Malta''s fertility rate is below the EU average, and population growth in recent years has largely been from immigration, putting increasing pressure on the pension system. Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008. Malta''s economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing, and tourism, and was hurt by the global economic downturn. Malta has low unemployment relative to other European countries, and growth has recovered since the 2009 recession. Malta''s financial services industry has grown in recent years and it has avoided contagion from the European financial crisis, largely because its debt is mostly held domestically and its banks have low exposure to the sovereign debt of peripheral European countries. Malta reduced its deficit below 3 percent of GDP, leading the EU to dismiss its official excessive deficit procedure against Malta in 2012."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$11.45 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 151 $11.35 billion (2011 est.) $11.16 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$8.689 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"0.8% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 159 1.7% (2011 est.) 2.9% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$27,500 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 56 $27,300 (2011 est.) $26,900 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"14.3% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 108 14% of GDP (2011 est.) 13.4% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 60% government consumption: 21.2% investment in fixed capital: 14.8% investment in inventories: -1.4% exports of goods and services: 102.5% imports of goods and services: -96.9% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 1.5% industry: 13.4% services: 85.1% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"potatoes, cauliflower, grapes, wheat, barley, tomatoes, citrus, cut flowers, green peppers;
