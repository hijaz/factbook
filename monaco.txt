The principality also is a banking center and has successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. Monaco, however, is not a tax-free shelter; it charges nearly 20% value-added tax, collects stamp duties, and companies face a 33% tax on profits unless they can show that three-quarters of profits are generated within the principality. Monaco's reliance on tourism and banking for its economic growth has left it vulnerable to a downturn in France and other European economies which are the principality's main trade partners. In 2009, Monaco''s GDP fell by 11.5% as the euro-zone crisis precipitated a sharp drop in tourism and retail activity and home sales. A modest recovery ensued in 2010 with GDP growth of 2.5%, but Monaco''s economic prospects remain clouded in uncertainty tied to future euro-zone growth. Weak economic growth also has deteriorated public finances as the principality recorded a budget deficit of 1.3% of GDP in 2012. Monaco was formally removed from the OECD''s \"grey list\" of uncooperative tax jurisdictions in late 2009, but continues to face international pressure to abandon its banking secrecy laws and help combat tax evasion. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$5.748 billion (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 165 $5.47 billion (2010 est.) $5.337 billion (2009 est.) note: data are in 2011 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$5.748 billion (2011 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"5.1% (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 65 2.5% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$70,700 (2011) country comparison to the world: 6 $63,500 (2009 est.) $61,900 (2008 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 0% industry: 10% services: 90% (2011)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"none"},"industries":{"value":"tourism, construction, small-scale industrial and consumer products"},"industrial production growth rate":{"value":"NA%"},"labor force":{"value":"50,580 country comparison to the world: 190 note: includes workers from all foreign countries (2011 est.)"},"unemployment rate":{"value":"0% (2011) country comparison to the world: 2"},"population below poverty line":{"value":"NA%"},"household income or consumption by percentage share":{"value":"lowest 10%: NA% highest 10%: NA%"},"budget":{"value":"revenues: $1.125 billion expenditures: $1.197 billion (2011 est.)"},"taxes and other revenues":{"value":"19.6% of GDP (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 170"},"budget surplus (+) or deficit (-)":{"value":"-1.3% of GDP (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 69"},"fiscal year":{"value":"calendar year"},"inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"value":"1.5% (2010) country comparison to the world: 31"},"market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"exports":{"value":"$864.6 million (2011) country comparison to the world: 161 $684.9 million (2010) note: full customs integration with France, which collects and rebates Monegasque trade duties; also participates in EU market system through customs union with France"},"imports":{"value":"$847.9 million (2011) country comparison to the world: 183 $850.2 million (2010) note: full customs integration with France, which collects and rebates Monegasque trade duties; also participates in EU market system through customs union with France"},"debt - external":{"value":"$NA"},"exchange rates":{"value":"euros (EUR) per US dollar - 0.78 (2012 est.) 0.72 (2011 est.) 0.76 (2010 est.) 0.72 (2009 est.) 0.68 (2008 est.)"}},"communications":{"telephones - main lines in use":{"value":"44,500 (2012) country comparison to the world: 166"},"telephones - mobile cellular":{"value":"33,200 (2012) country comparison to the world: 207"},"telephone system":{"value":"general assessment: modern automatic telephone system; the country's sole fixed line operator offers a full range of services to residential and business customers domestic: combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity exceeds 200 per 100 persons international: country code - 377; no satellite earth stations; connected by cable into the French communications system (2011)"},"broadcast media":{"value":"TV Monte-Carlo (TMC) operates a TV network; cable TV available; Radio Monte-Carlo has extensive radio networks in France and Italy with French-language broadcasts to France beginning in the 1960s and Italian-language broadcasts to Italy beginning in the 1970s; other radio stations include Riviera Radio and Radio Monaco (2012)"},"internet country code":{"value":".mc"},"internet hosts":{"value":"26,009 (2012) country comparison to the world: 111"},"internet users":{"value":"23,000 (2009) country comparison to the world: 191"}},"transportation":{"heliports":{"value":"1 (2012)"},"roadways":{"value":"total: 77 km country comparison to the world: 217 paved: 77 km (2010)"},"merchant marine":{"value":"registered in other countries: 64 (Bahamas 8, Bermuda 2, Liberia 8, Malta 3, Marshall Islands 30, Panama 11, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 2) (2010) country comparison to the world: 63"},"ports and terminals":{"value":"Monaco"}},"military":{"military branches":{"value":"no regular military forces; Directorate of Public Security (2012)"},"manpower available for military service":{"value":"males age 16-49: 5,749 (2010 est.)"},"manpower fit for military service":{"value":"males age 16-49: 4,629 females age 16-49: 4,597 (2010 est.)"},"manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"value":"male: 153 female: 141 (2010 est.)"},"military - note":{"value":"defense is the responsibility of France"}},"transnational issues":{"disputes - international":{"value":"none"}}}}}
