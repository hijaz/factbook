The French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa's highest per capita incomes."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Southern Africa, island in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"20 17 S, 57 33 E"},"map references":{"value":"Africa"},"area":{"value":"total: 2,040 sq km country comparison to the world: 181 land: 2,030 sq km water: 10 sq km note: includes Agalega Islands, Cargados Carajos Shoals (Saint Brandon), and Rodrigues"},"area - comparative":{"value":"almost 11 times the size of Washington, DC"},"land boundaries":{"value":"0 km"},"coastline":{"value":"177 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"measured from claimed archipelagic straight baselines territorial sea: 12 nm exclusive economic zone: 200 nm continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"climate":{"value":"tropical, modified by southeast trade winds;

This achievement has been reflected in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than 32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its strong textile sector, has been well poised to take advantage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Mauritius' sound economic policies and prudent banking practices helped to mitigate negative effects of the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew in the 3-4% per year range in 2010-12, and the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach around the globe."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$20.53 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 130 $19.88 billion (2011 est.) $19.15 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$11.47 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
