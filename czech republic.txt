{"europe":{"czech republic":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"At the close of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, having rejected a federal system, the new country's predominantly Czech leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the Slovaks, the Sudeten Germans, and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). On the eve of World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the Czech part of the country and Slovakia became an independent state allied with Germany. After the war, a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create \"socialism with a human face,\" ushering in a period of repression known as \"normalization.\" The peaceful \"Velvet Revolution\" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a nonviolent \"velvet divorce\" into its two national components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Central Europe, between Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and Austria"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"49 45 N, 15 30 E"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 78,867 sq km country comparison to the world: 116 land: 77,247 sq km water: 1,620 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than South Carolina"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 1,989 km border countries: Austria 362 km, Germany 815 km, Poland 615 km, Slovakia 197 km"},"coastline":{"value":"0 km (landlocked)"},"maritime claims":{"value":"none (landlocked)"},"climate":{"value":"temperate;

While the conservative, inward-looking Czech financial system has remained relatively healthy, the small, open, export-driven Czech economy remains sensitive to changes in the economic performance of its main export markets, especially Germany. When Western Europe and Germany fell into recession in late 2008, demand for Czech goods plunged, leading to double digit drops in industrial production and exports. As a result, real GDP fell 4.7% in 2009, with most of the decline occurring during the first quarter. Real GDP, however, slowly recovered with positive quarter-on-quarter growth starting in the second half of 2009 and continuing throughout 2011. In 2012, however, the economy fell into a recession due to a slump in external demand. The auto industry remains the largest single industry, and, together with its upstream suppliers, accounts for nearly 24% of Czech manufacturing. The Czech Republic produced more than a million cars for the first time in 2010, over 80% of which were exported. Foreign and domestic businesses alike voice concerns about corruption especially in public procurement. Other long term challenges include dealing with a rapidly aging population, funding an unsustainable pension and health care system, and diversifying away from manufacturing and toward a more high-tech, services-based, knowledge economy."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$291.7 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 44 $295.4 billion (2011 est.) $289.9 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$196.1 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
