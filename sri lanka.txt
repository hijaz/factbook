{"south asia":{"sri lanka":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"The first Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century B.C., probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced in about the mid-third century B.C., and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura (kingdom from circa 200 B.C. to circa A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In the 14th century, a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom in northern Sri Lanka. The coastal areas of the island were controlled by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century. The island was ceded to the British in 1796, became a crown colony in 1802, and was formally united under British rule by 1815. As Ceylon, it became independent in 1948; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972. Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983. After two decades of fighting, the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) formalized a cease-fire in February 2002 with Norway brokering peace negotiations. Violence between the LTTE and government forces intensified in 2006, but the government regained control of the Eastern Province in 2007. By May 2009, the government announced that its military had defeated the remnants of the LTTE. Since the end of the conflict, the government has enacted an ambitious program of economic development projects, many of which are financed by loans from the Government of China. In addition to efforts to reconstruct its economy, the government has resettled more than 95% of those civilians who were displaced during the final phase of the conflict and released the vast majority of former LTTE combatants captured by Government Security Forces. At the same time, there has been little progress on more contentious and politically difficult issues such as reaching a political settlement with Tamil elected representatives and holding accountable those alleged to have been involved in human rights violations at the end of the war."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Southern Asia, island in the Indian Ocean, south of India"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"7 00 N, 81 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Asia"},"area":{"value":"total: 65,610 sq km country comparison to the world: 122 land: 64,630 sq km water: 980 sq km"},"area -

The government's high debt payments and bloated civil service have contributed to historically high budget deficits, but fiscal consolidation efforts and strong GDP growth in recent years have helped bring down the government's fiscal deficit. However, low tax revenues are a major concern. The 2008-09 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka''s economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments crisis. Growth slowed to 3.5% in 2009. Economic activity rebounded with the end of the war and an IMF agreement, resulting in two straight years of 8% growth in 2010-11. Growth moderated to about 6% in 2012. Agriculture slowed due to a drought and weak global demand affected exports and trade. In early 2012, Sri Lanka floated the rupee, resulting in a sharp depreciation, and took steps to curb imports. A large trade deficit remains a concern. Strong remittances from Sri Lankan workers abroad have helped to offset the trade deficit."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$128.4 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 65 $120.6 billion (2011 est.) $111.4 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$59.41 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"6.4% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 36 8.2% (2011 est.) 8% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$6,200 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 148 $5,900 (2011 est.) $5,500 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"24% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 53 22.1% of GDP (2011 est.) 25.3% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 69.6% government consumption: 13.5% investment in fixed capital: 28.9% investment in inventories: 1.8% exports of goods and services: 22.8% imports of goods and services: -36.5% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 11.1% industry: 31.5% services: 57.5% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"rice, sugarcane, grains, pulses, oilseed, spices, vegetables, fruit, tea, rubber, coconuts;

some Sri Lankan adults and children who migrate willingly to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Malaysia, and Singapore to work as domestic servants, construction workers, or garment factory workers face conditions indicative of forced labor; some Sri Lankan women are forced into prostitution in Jordan, Singapore, Maldives, and other countries; within Sri Lanka, women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in brothels, while other children are forced to work in the agriculture, fireworks, and fish-drying industries tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Sri Lanka does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; law enforcement efforts and victim protection, particularly identification, are very weak, with no reported prosecutions or convictions under the country's penal code article prohibiting human trafficking; government employees' complicity in trafficking offenses remains a problem; the government has not approved its draft standard operating procedures for identifying trafficking victims and referring them to protective services, consequently, victims may have been punished for crimes committed as a direct result of being trafficked; the government adopted an anti-trafficking action plan in 2012 (2013)"}}}}}
