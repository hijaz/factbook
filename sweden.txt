It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external communications, and a highly skilled labor force. In September 2003, Swedish voters turned down entry into the euro system concerned about the impact on the economy and sovereignty. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for vast majority of industrial output, of which the engineering sector accounts for about 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for little more than 1% of GDP and of employment. Until 2008, Sweden was in the midst of a sustained economic upswing, boosted by increased domestic demand and strong exports. This and robust finances offered the center-right government considerable scope to implement its reform program aimed at increasing employment, reducing welfare dependence, and streamlining the state's role in the economy. Despite strong finances and underlying fundamentals, the Swedish economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2008 and the contraction continued in 2009 as deteriorating global conditions reduced export demand and consumption. Strong exports of commodities and a return to profitability by Sweden's banking sector drove the strong rebound in 2010, which continued in 2011, but growth slipped to 1.2% in 2012. The government proposed stimulus measures in 2012 to curb the effects of a global economic slowdown and boost employment and growth."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$399.4 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 35 $394.7 billion (2011 est.) $380.4 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$526.2 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"1.2% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 157 3.8% (2011 est.) 6.3% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$41,900 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 24 $41,600 (2011 est.) $40,400 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"25.8% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 43 26.9% of GDP (2011 est.) 25.6% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 48.4% government consumption: 26.9% investment in fixed capital: 19% investment in inventories: -0.1% exports of goods and services: 48.6% imports of goods and services: -42.7% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 2% industry: 32.1% services: 66% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"barley, wheat, sugar beets;
