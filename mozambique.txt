Large-scale emigration, economic dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil war hindered the country's development until the mid 1990s. The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between Frelimo and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) forces ended the fighting in 1992. In December 2004, Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His elected successor, Armando Emilio GUEBUZA, promised to continue the sound economic policies that have encouraged foreign investment. President GUEBUZA was reelected to a second term in October 2009. However, the elections were flawed by voter fraud, questionable disqualification of candidates, and Frelimo use of government resources during the campaign. As a result, Freedom House removed Mozambique from its list of electoral democracies."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Southeastern Africa, bordering the Mozambique Channel, between South Africa and Tanzania"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"18 15 S, 35 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Africa"},"area":{"value":"total: 799,380 sq km country comparison to the world: 35 land: 786,380 sq km water: 13,000 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly less than twice the size of California"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 4,571 km border countries: Malawi 1,569 km, South Africa 491 km, Swaziland 105 km, Tanzania 756 km, Zambia 419 km, Zimbabwe 1,231 km"},"coastline":{"value":"2,470 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm exclusive economic zone: 200 nm"},"climate":{"value":"tropical to subtropical"},"terrain":{"value":"mostly coastal lowlands, uplands in center, high plateaus in northwest, mountains in west"},"elevation extremes":{"value":"lowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m highest point: Monte Binga 2,436 m"},"natural resources":{"value":"coal, titanium, natural gas, hydropower, tantalum, graphite"},"land use":{"value":"arable land: 6.51% permanent crops: 0.25% other: 93.24% (2011)"},"irrigated land":{"value":"1,181 sq km (2003)"},"total renewable water resources":{"value":"217.1 cu km (2011)"},"freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"value":"total: 0.88 cu km/yr (26%/4%/70%) per capita: 46.05 cu m/yr (2005)"},"natural hazards":{"value":"severe droughts;

Socialist mismanagement and a brutal civil war from 1977-92 exacerbated the situation. In 1987, the government embarked on a series of macroeconomic reforms designed to stabilize the economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance and with political stability since the multi-party elections in 1994, have led to dramatic improvements in the country's growth rate. Fiscal reforms, including the introduction of a value-added tax and reform of the customs service, have improved the government's revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains, Mozambique remained dependent upon foreign assistance for 40% of its 2012 annual budget and over half the population remained below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture continues to employ the vast majority of the country's work force and smallholder agricultural productivity and productivity growth is weak. A substantial trade imbalance persists although aluminum production from the Mozal smelter has significantly boosted export earnings in recent years. In 2012, The Mozambican government took over Portugal's last remaining share in the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectricity Company (HCB), a signficant contributor to the Southern African Power Pool. The government has plans to expand the Cahora Bassa Dam and build additional dams to increase its electricity exports and fulfill the needs of its burgeoning domestic industries. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives, and is now at a manageable level. In July 2007, the US government's Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed a $506.9 million Compact with Mozambique. Compact projects will end in September 2013 and are focusing on improving sanitation, roads, agriculture, and the business regulation environment in an effort to spur economic growth in the four northern provinces of the country. Citizens rioted in September 2010, after fuel, water, electricity, and bread price increases were announced. In an attempt to lessen the negative impact on people, the government implemented subsidies, decreased taxes and tariffs, and instituted other fiscal measures. Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 6%-8% in the decade up to 2012, one of Africa's strongest performances. Mozambique's ability to attract large investment projects in natural resources is expected to fuel continued high growth in coming years. Revenues from these vast resources, including natural gas, coal, titanium and hydroelectric capacity, could overtake donor assistance within five years."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$26.69 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 120 $24.83 billion (2011 est.) $23.13 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$14.6 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"7.5% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 25 7.3% (2011 est.) 7.1% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$1,200 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 209 $1,100 (2011 est.) $1,100 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"-4.6% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 143 0.8% of GDP (2011 est.) 5.4% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 75.4% government consumption: 13.7% investment in fixed capital: 31.7% investment in inventories: -1.2% exports of goods and services: 29.5% imports of goods and services: -49.1% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 29.9% industry: 24.6% services: 45.5% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"cotton, cashew nuts, sugarcane, tea, cassava (tapioca), corn, coconuts, sisal, citrus and tropical fruits, potatoes, sunflowers;
