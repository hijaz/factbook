{"africa":{"guinea-bissau":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Since independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has experienced considerable political and military upheaval. In 1980, a military coup established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a path to a market economy and multiparty system, VIEIRA's regime was characterized by the suppression of political opposition and the purging of political rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the country's first free elections. A military mutiny and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In February 2000, a transitional government turned over power to opposition leader Kumba YALA after he was elected president in transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in office, YALA was overthrown in a bloodless military coup, and businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In 2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to pursue economic development and national reconciliation; he was assassinated in March 2009. Malam Bacai SANHA was elected in an emergency election held in June 2009, but he passed away in January 2012 from an existing illness. A military coup in April 2012 prevented Guinea-Bissau's second-round presidential election - to determine SANHA's successor - from taking place."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Guinea and Senegal"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"12 00 N, 15 00 W"},"map references":{"value":"Africa"},"area":{"value":"total: 36,125 sq km country comparison to the world: 138 land: 28,120 sq km water: 8,005 sq km"},"area -

overview":{"value":"One of the poorest countries in the world, Guinea-Bissau's legal economy depends mainly on farming and fishing, but trafficking in narcotics is probably the most lucrative trade. The combination of limited economic prospects, a weak and faction-ridden government, and favorable geography have made this West African country a way station for drugs bound for Europe. Cashew crops have increased remarkably in recent years; low rainfall hindered cereals and other crops in 2011. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along with small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice is the major crop and staple food. However, intermittent fighting between Senegalese-backed government troops and a military junta destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and caused widespread damage to the economy in 1998; the civil war led to a 28% drop in GDP that year, with partial recovery in 1999-2002. In December 2003, the World Bank, IMF, and UNDP were forced to step in to provide emergency budgetary support in the amount of $107 million for 2004, representing over 80% of the total national budget. The government is successfully implementing a three-year $33 million extended credit arrangement with the IMF that runs through 2012. In December 2010 the World Bank and IMF announced support for $1.2 billion worth of debt relief. Guinea-Bissau made progress with debt relief in 2011 when members of the Paris Club opted to write-off much of the country's obligations."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$1.963 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 193 $1.992 billion (2011 est.) $1.891 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$870 million (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"-1.5% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 201 5.3% (2011 est.) 3.5% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$1,200 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 211 $1,300 (2011 est.) $1,200 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 74.6% government consumption: 11.6% investment in fixed capital: 11.6% investment in inventories: 0% exports of goods and services: 21.5% imports of goods and services: -19.3% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 57.6% industry: 13.6% services: 28.7% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"rice, corn, beans, cassava (manioc), cashew nuts, peanuts, palm kernels, cotton;
