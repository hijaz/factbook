{"europe":{"andorra":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"The landlocked Principality of Andorra is one of the smallest states in Europe, nestled high in the Pyrenees Mountains between the French and Spanish borders. For 715 years, from 1278 to 1993, Andorrans lived under a unique co-principality, ruled by French and Spanish leaders (from 1607 onward, the French chief of state and the Spanish bishop of Seu d'Urgell). In 1993, this feudal system was modified, with the titular heads of state retained, but the government transformed into a parliamentary democracy. In the late 20th century, Andorra became a popular tourist destination. An estimated 10 million people visit each year drawn by the winter sports, summer climate, and duty free goods. Andorra has also become a wealthy international commercial center because of its banking facilities, low taxes, and lack of customs duties. However, recent economic hardships have required Andorra to start taxing foreign investments and to implement stricter economic policies. Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a special relationship with it and uses the Euro as its national currency."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Southwestern Europe, Pyrenees mountains, on the border between France and Spain"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"42 30 N, 1 30 E"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 468 sq km country comparison to the world: 196 land: 468 sq km water: 0 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"2.5 times the size of Washington, DC"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 120.3 km border countries: France 56.6 km, Spain 63.7 km"},"coastline":{"value":"0 km (landlocked)"},"maritime claims":{"value":"none (landlocked)"},"climate":{"value":"temperate;

Andorra's duty-free status for some products and its summer and winter resorts attract millions of visitors annually, although the economic downturn in neighboring countries has curtailed tourism activity. The banking sector also contributes substantially to the economy. Andorra's comparative advantage as a tax haven eroded when the borders of neighboring France and Spain opened; its bank secrecy laws have been relaxed under pressure from the EU and OECD. Agricultural production is limited - only 2% of the land is arable - and most food has to be imported, making the economy vulnerable to changes in fuel and food prices. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing output and exports consist mainly of perfumes and cosmetic products, products of the printing industry, electrical machinery and equipment, clothing, tobacco products, and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra uses the euro and is effectively subject to the monetary policy of the European Central Bank. Slower growth in Spain and France has dimmed Andorra's economic prospects. Since 2010, a drop in tourism contributed to a contraction in GDP and a sharp deterioration of public finances, prompting the government to begin implementing several austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit, including levying a special corporate tax. To bring in new revenue and diversify future sources of economic growth, the government approved in July 2012 a new foreign investment law opening investment to foreign capital."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$3.163 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 179 $3.214 billion (2011 est.) $3.227 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$4.8 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"-1.6% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 202 -0.4% (2011 est.) -1.9% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$37,200 (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 33 $37,700 (2010 est.) $37,900 (2009 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 14% industry: 79% services: 6% (2011 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"small quantities of rye, wheat, barley, oats, vegetables; sheep"},"industries":{"value":"tourism (particularly skiing), banking, tobacco, cattle raising, timber, furniture"},"industrial production growth rate":{"value":"NA%"},"labor force":{"value":"36,060 (2012) country comparison to the world: 201"},"labor force - by occupation":{"value":"agriculture: 0.4% industry: 4.7% services: 94.9% (2010)"},"unemployment rate":{"value":"2.9% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 23 1.9% (2011 est.)"},"population below poverty line":{"value":"NA% (2008)"},"household income or consumption by percentage share":{"value":"lowest 10%: NA% highest 10%: NA%"},"budget":{"value":"revenues: $403 million expenditures: $470 million (2011)"},"taxes and other revenues":{"value":"8.4% of GDP (2011) country comparison to the world: 210"},"budget surplus (+) or deficit (-)":{"value":"-1.4% of GDP (2011) country comparison to the world: 72"},"fiscal year":{"value":"calendar year"},"inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"value":"1.1% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 15 -2.5% (2011 est.)"},"exports":{"value":"$70 million (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 192 $72 million (2011 est.)"},"exports - commodities":{"value":"tobacco products, furniture"},"imports":{"value":"$1.43 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 172 $1.501 billion (2011 est.)"},"imports - commodities":{"value":"consumer goods, food, electricity"},"debt - external":{"value":"$NA"},"exchange rates":{"value":"euros (EUR) per US dollar - 0.78 (2012 est.) 0.72 (2011 est.) 0.76 (2010 est.) 0.72 (2009 est.) 0.68 (2008 est.)"}},"energy":{"electricity - production":{"value":"91.24 million kWh (2011) country comparison to the world: 199"},"electricity - consumption":{"value":"562.4 million kWh (2012) country comparison to the world: 167"},"electricity - exports":{"value":"1 million kWh (2011) country comparison to the world: 90"},"electricity - imports":{"value":"587 million kWh (2011) country comparison to the world: 74"}},"communications":{"telephones - main lines in use":{"value":"39,000 (2012) country comparison to the world: 170"},"telephones - mobile cellular":{"value":"65,000 (2012) country comparison to the world: 198"},"telephone system":{"value":"general assessment: modern automatic telephone system domestic: modern system with microwave radio relay connections between exchanges international: country code - 376; landline circuits to France and Spain (2012)"},"broadcast media":{"value":"1 public TV station and 2 public radio stations; about 10 commercial radio stations; good reception of radio and TV broadcasts from stations in France and Spain; upgraded to terrestrial digital TV broadcasting in 2007; roughly 25 international TV channels available (2012)"},"internet country code":{"value":".ad"},"internet hosts":{"value":"28,383 (2012) country comparison to the world: 109"},"internet users":{"value":"67,100 (2009) country comparison to the world: 171"}},"transportation":{"roadways":{"value":"total: 320 km (2008) country comparison to the world: 203"}},"military":{"military branches":{"value":"no regular military forces, Police Service of Andorra (2011)"},"manpower available for military service":{"value":"males age 16-49: 22,390 (2010 est.)"},"manpower fit for military service":{"value":"males age 16-49: 17,977 females age 16-49: 17,069 (2010 est.)"},"manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"value":"male: 397 female: 347 (2010 est.)"},"military - note":{"value":"defense is the responsibility of France and Spain"}},"transnational issues":{"disputes - international":{"value":"none"}}}}}
