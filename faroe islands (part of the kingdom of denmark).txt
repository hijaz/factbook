The sector normally accounts for about 95% of exports and nearly half of GDP. In early 2008 the Faroese economy began to slow as a result of smaller catches and historically high oil prices. The slowdown in the Faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid-1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6%, mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming, and high export prices. Unemployment reached its lowest level in June 2008 at 1.1%. The Faroese Home Rule Government produced increasing budget surpluses in that period, which helped to reduce the large public debt, most of it to Denmark. However, total dependence on fishing and salmon farming make the Faroese economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world demand. Initial discoveries of oil in the Faroese area give hope for eventual oil production, which may provide a foundation for a more diversified economy and less dependence on Danish economic assistance. Aided by an annual subsidy from Denmark amounting to about 3% of Faroese GDP, the Faroese have a standard of living almost equal to that of Denmark and Greenland. The Faroese Government ran relatively large deficits from 2008 to 2010 and budget deficits are forecast for several years ahead. At year-end 2010 the gross debt had reached approximately US$900 million."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$1.471 billion (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 197 $1.389 billion (2008 est.)"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$2.32 billion (2010 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"2.9% (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 114 0.5% (2008 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$30,500 (2008 est.) country comparison to the world: 45"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 16% industry: 29% services: 55% (2007 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"milk, potatoes, vegetables;
