The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US its principal trading partner. Canada enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US, which absorbs about three-fourths of Canadian exports each year. Canada is the US's largest foreign supplier of energy, including oil, gas, uranium, and electric power. Given its great natural resources, highly skilled labor force, and modern capital plant, Canada enjoyed solid economic growth from 1993 through 2007. Buffeted by the global economic crisis, the economy dropped into a sharp recession in the final months of 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009 after 12 years of surplus. Canada's major banks, however, emerged from the financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the world, owing to the financial sector's tradition of conservative lending practices and strong capitalization. Canada achieved marginal growth in 2010-12 and plans to balance the budget by 2015. In addition, the country's petroleum sector is rapidly becoming an even larger economic driver with Alberta's oil sands significantly boosting Canada's proven oil reserves, ranking the country third in the world behind Saudi Arabia and Venezuela."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$1.513 trillion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 14 $1.485 trillion (2011 est.) $1.448 trillion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$1.819 trillion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"1.8% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 144 2.6% (2011 est.) 3.2% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$43,400 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 20 $43,100 (2011 est.) $42,500 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"21.2% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 68 21.1% of GDP (2011 est.) 19.8% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 55.6% government consumption: 21.7% investment in fixed capital: 24.1% investment in inventories: 0.5% exports of goods and services: 30% imports of goods and services: -32% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 1.7% industry: 28.5% services: 69.8% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"wheat, barley, oilseed, tobacco, fruits, vegetables;
