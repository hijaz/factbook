{"central asia":{"kyrgyzstan":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions, most of Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to Russia in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of President Askar AKAEV, who had run the country since 1990. Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Over the next few years, the new president manipulated the parliament to accrue new powers for himself. In July 2009, after months of harassment against his opponents and media critics, BAKIEV won re-election in a presidential campaign that the international community deemed flawed. In April 2010, violent protests in Bishkek led to the collapse of the BAKIEV regime and his eventual fleeing to Minsk, Belarus. His successor, Roza OTUNBAEVA, served as transitional president until Almazbek ATAMBAEV was inaugurated in December 2011. Continuing concerns include: the trajectory of democratization, endemic corruption, poor interethnic relations, and terrorism."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Central Asia, west of China, south of Kazakhstan"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"41 00 N, 75 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Asia"},"area":{"value":"total: 199,951 sq km country comparison to the world: 87 land: 191,801 sq km water: 8,150 sq km"},"area -

Cotton, tobacco, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products, although only tobacco and cotton are exported in any quantity. Industrial exports include gold, mercury, uranium, natural gas, and electricity. The economy depends heavily on gold exports - mainly from output at the Kumtor gold mine - and on remittances from Kyrgyzstani migrant workers primarily in Russia. Following independence, Kyrgyzstan was progressive in carrying out market reforms, such as an improved regulatory system and land reform. Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. Much of the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in production had been severe after the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995, production began to recover and exports began to increase. In 2005, the BAKIEV government and international financial institutions initiated a comprehensive medium-term poverty reduction and economic growth strategy. The government made steady strides in controlling its substantial fiscal deficit, nearly closing the gap between revenues and expenditures in 2006, before boosting expenditures more than 20% in 2007-08. GDP grew about 8% annually in 2007-08, partly due to higher gold prices internationally, but slowed to 2.9% in 2009. The overthrow of President BAKIEV in April 2010 and subsequent ethnic clashes left hundreds dead and damaged infrastructure. Shrinking trade and agricultural production, as well as the political instability caused by the change in government, caused GDP to contract 0.5% in 2010. The fiscal deficit widened to 11% of GDP in 2010, reflecting significant increases in crisis-related spending, including both rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and bank recapitalization. The economy grew 5.7% in 2011, but slowed to around 1% in 2012, primarily due to an 83% decrease in production from Kumtor. As a result, the budget deficit increased at year's end. Progress in fighting corruption, improving transparency in licensing, business permits and taxations, restructuring domestic industry, and attracting foreign aid and investment are key to future growth."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$13.5 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 144 $13.62 billion (2011 est.) $12.85 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$6.473 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"-0.9% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 194 6% (2011 est.) -0.5% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$2,400 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 184 $2,500 (2011 est.) $2,300 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"2.4% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 140 15% of GDP (2011 est.) 19.2% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 88% government consumption: 17.6% investment in fixed capital: 25.5% investment in inventories: -0.2% exports of goods and services: 53.6% imports of goods and services: -84.4% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 21.3% industry: 32.6% services: 46.1% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"tobacco, cotton, potatoes, vegetables, grapes, fruits and berries;
