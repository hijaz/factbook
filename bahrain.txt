In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in 1971. Facing declining oil reserves, Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining and has become an international banking center. Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. The Sunni-led government has struggled to manage relations with its large Shia-majority population. In early 2011, amid Arab uprisings elsewhere in the region, the Bahraini Government confronted similar protests at home with police and military action. The aftermath led to modest reforms, though continued dissatisfaction by Bahraini oppositionists with the extent of the reforms, has led to a broader dialogue between government officials, political societies, and legislators."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Middle East, archipelago in the Persian Gulf, east of Saudi Arabia"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"26 00 N, 50 33 E"},"map references":{"value":"Middle East"},"area":{"value":"total: 760 sq km country comparison to the world: 188 land: 760 sq km water: 0 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"3.5 times the size of Washington, DC"},"land boundaries":{"value":"0 km"},"coastline":{"value":"161 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm contiguous zone: 24 nm continental shelf: extending to boundaries to be determined"},"climate":{"value":"arid;

As part of its diversification plans, Bahrain implemented a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US in August 2006, the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state. Bahrain's economy, however, continues to depend heavily on oil. Petroleum production and refining account for more than 60% of Bahrain's export receipts, 70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP. Other major economic activities are production of aluminum - Bahrain's second biggest export after oil - finance, and construction. Bahrain competes with Malaysia as a worldwide center for Islamic banking and continues to seek new natural gas supplies as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum industries. In 2011 and 2012, Bahrain experienced economic setbacks as a result of domestic unrest, however, several factors indicate that the economy is beginning to recover, such as the return of the formula one race and tourist cruise ships to Bahrain. Economic policies aimed at restoring confidence in Bahrain's economy, such as the suspension of an expatriate labor tax and frequent bailouts of Gulf Air, will make Bahrain's foremost long-term economic challenges - youth unemployment and the growth of government debt - more difficult to address."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$33.63 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 109 $32.39 billion (2011 est.) $31.72 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$27.03 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
