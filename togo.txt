Gnassingbe EYADEMA, installed as military ruler in 1967, ruled Togo with a heavy hand for almost four decades. Despite the facade of multi-party elections instituted in the early 1990s, the government was largely dominated by President EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) party has maintained power almost continually since 1967 and maintains a majority of seats in today's legislature. Upon EYADEMA's death in February 2005, the military installed the president's son, Faure GNASSINGBE, and then engineered his formal election two months later. Democratic gains since then allowed Togo to hold its first relatively free and fair legislative elections in October 2007. After years of political unrest and condemnation from international organizations for human rights abuses, Togo is finally being re-welcomed into the international community. In January 2012, Togo assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2012-13 term."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Western Africa, bordering the Bight of Benin, between Benin and Ghana"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"8 00 N, 1 10 E"},"map references":{"value":"Africa"},"area":{"value":"total: 56,785 sq km country comparison to the world: 126 land: 54,385 sq km water: 2,400 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than West Virginia"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 1,647 km border countries: Benin 644 km, Burkina Faso 126 km, Ghana 877 km"},"coastline":{"value":"56 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 30 nm exclusive economic zone: 200 nm"},"climate":{"value":"tropical;
