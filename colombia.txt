{"south america":{"colombia":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and Venezuela). A nearly five-decade long conflict between government forces and anti-government insurgent groups, principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) heavily funded by the drug trade, escalated during the 1990s. More than 31,000 former paramilitaries had demobilized by the end of 2006 and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia as a formal organization had ceased to function. In the wake of the paramilitary demobilization, emerging criminal groups arose, whose members include some former paramilitaries. The insurgents lack the military or popular support necessary to overthrow the government, but continue attacks against civilians. Large areas of the countryside are under guerrilla influence or are contested by security forces. In October 2012, the Colombian Government started formal peace negotiations with the FARC aimed at reaching a definitive bilateral ceasefire and incorporating demobilized FARC members into mainstream society and politics. The Colombian Government has stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the country, and now has a presence in every one of its administrative departments. Despite decades of internal conflict and drug related security challenges, Colombia maintains relatively strong democratic institutions characterized by peaceful, transparent elections and the protection of civil liberties."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Northern South America, bordering the Caribbean Sea, between Panama and Venezuela, and bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between Ecuador and Panama"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"4 00 N, 72 00 W"},"map references":{"value":"South America"},"area":{"value":"total: 1,138,910 sq km country comparison to the world: 26 land: 1,038,700 sq km water: 100,210 sq km note: includes Isla de Malpelo, Roncador Cay, and Serrana Bank"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly less than twice the size of Texas"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 6,309 km border countries: Brazil 1,644 km, Ecuador 590 km, Panama 225 km, Peru 1,800 km, Venezuela 2,050 km"},"coastline":{"value":"3,208 km (Caribbean Sea 1,760 km, North Pacific Ocean 1,448 km)"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm exclusive economic zone: 200 nm continental shelf: 200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"climate":{"value":"tropical along coast and eastern plains; cooler in highlands"},"terrain":{"value":"flat coastal lowlands, central highlands, high Andes Mountains, eastern lowland plains (Llanos)"},"elevation extremes":{"value":"lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m highest point: Pico Cristobal Colon 5,775 m note: nearby Pico Simon Bolivar also has the same elevation"},"natural resources":{"value":"petroleum, natural gas, coal, iron ore, nickel, gold, copper, emeralds, hydropower"},"land use":{"value":"arable land: 1.84% permanent crops: 1.66% other: 96.5% (2011)"},"irrigated land":{"value":"10,870 sq km (2011)"},"total renewable water resources":{"value":"2,132 cu km (2011)"},"freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"value":"total: 12.65 cu km/yr (55%/4%/41%) per capita: 308 cu m/yr (2010)"},"natural hazards":{"value":"highlands subject to volcanic eruptions; occasional earthquakes; periodic droughts volcanism: Galeras (elev. 4,276 m) is one of Colombia's most active volcanoes, having erupted in 2009 and 2010 causing major evacuations; it has been deemed a \"Decade Volcano\" by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to its explosive history and close proximity to human populations; Nevado del Ruiz (elev. 5,321 m), 129 km (80 mi) west of Bogota, erupted in 1985 producing lahars that killed 23,000 people; the volcano last erupted in 1991; additionally, after 500 years of dormancy, Nevado del Huila reawakened in 2007 and has experienced frequent eruptions since then; other historically active volcanoes include Cumbal, Dona Juana, Nevado del Tolima, and Purace"},"environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation; soil and water quality damage from overuse of pesticides; air pollution, especially in Bogota, from vehicle emissions"},"environment - international agreements":{"value":"party to: Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands signed, but not ratified: Law of the Sea"},"geography - note":{"value":"only South American country with coastlines on both the North Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea"}},"people and society":{"nationality":{"value":"noun: Colombian(s) adjective: Colombian"},"ethnic groups":{"value":"mestizo 58%, white 20%, mulatto 14%, black 4%, mixed black-Amerindian 3%, Amerindian 1%"},"languages":{"value":"Spanish (official)"},"religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 90%, other 10%"},"demographic profile":{"value":"Colombia is in the midst of a demographic transition resulting from steady declines in its fertility, mortality, and population growth rates.

However, income inequality is among the worst in the world, and more than a third of the population lives below the poverty line. Colombia experiences significant legal and illegal economic emigration and refugee flows. Large-scale labor emigration dates to the 1960s; Venezuela and the United States continue to be the main host countries. Colombia is the largest source of Latin American refugees in Latin America, nearly 400,000 of whom live primarily in Venezuela and Ecuador. Forced displacement remains prevalent because of violence among guerrillas, paramilitary groups, and Colombian security forces. Afro-Colombian and indigenous populations are disproportionately affected. A leading NGO estimates that 5.2 million people have been displaced since 1985, while the Colombian Government estimates 3.6 million since 2000. These estimates may undercount actual numbers because not all internally displaced persons are registered. Historically, Colombia also has one of the world's highest levels of forced disappearances. About 30,000 cases have been recorded over the last four decades - although the number is likely to be much higher - including human rights activists, trade unionists, Afro-Colombians, indigenous people, and farmers in rural conflict zones."},"population":{"value":"45,745,783 (July 2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 30"},"age structure":{"value":"0-14 years: 25.8% (male 6,032,725/female 5,755,437) 15-24 years: 18.2% (male 4,241,621/female 4,101,552) 25-54 years: 41.5% (male 9,376,745/female 9,597,744) 55-64 years: 8% (male 1,705,451/female 1,962,606) 65 years and over: 6.5% (male 1,242,980/female 1,728,922) (2013 est.) population pyramid:"},"dependency ratios":{"value":"total dependency ratio: 51.2 % youth dependency ratio: 41.9 % elderly dependency ratio: 9.3 % potential support ratio: 10.7 (2013)"},"median age":{"value":"total: 28.6 years male: 27.6 years female: 29.5 years (2013 est.)"},"population growth rate":{"value":"1.1% (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 108"},"birth rate":{"value":"16.98 births/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 118"},"death rate":{"value":"5.33 deaths/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 178"},"net migration rate":{"value":"-0.66 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 142"},"urbanization":{"value":"urban population: 75% of total population (2010) rate of urbanization: 1.7% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"major urban areas - population":{"value":"BOGOTA (capital) 8.744 million;

Real GDP has grown more than 4% per year for the past three years, continuing almost a decade of strong economic performance. All three major ratings agencies have upgraded Colombia's government debt to investment grade. Nevertheless, Colombia depends heavily on oil exports, making it vulnerable to a drop in oil prices. Economic development is stymied by inadequate infrastructure, weakened further by recent flooding. Moreover, the unemployment rate of 10.3% in 2012 is still one of Latin America's highest. The SANTOS Administration's foreign policy has focused on bolstering Colombia's commercial ties and boosting investment at home. The US-Colombia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was ratified by the US Congress in October 2011 and implemented in 2012. Colombia has signed or is negotiating FTAs with a number of other countries, including Canada, Chile, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU, Venezuela, South Korea, Turkey, Japan, China, Costa Rica, Panama, and Israel. Foreign direct investment - notably in the oil and gas sectors - reached a record $10 billion in 2008 but dropped to $7.2 billion in 2009, before beginning to recover in 2010, and reached a record high of nearly $16 billion in 2012. Colombia is the third largest Latin American exporter of oil to the United States, and the United States' largest source of imported coal. Inequality, underemployment, and narcotrafficking remain significant challenges, and Colombia's infrastructure requires major improvements to sustain economic expansion."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$511.1 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 29 $491.5 billion (2011 est.) $460.8 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$366 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
