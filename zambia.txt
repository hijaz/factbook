During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining spurred development and immigration. The name was changed to Zambia upon independence in 1964. In the 1980s and 1990s, declining copper prices, economic mismanagement and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991 brought an end to one-party rule, but the subsequent vote in 1996 saw blatant harassment of opposition parties. The election in 2001 was marked by administrative problems with three parties filing a legal petition challenging the election of ruling party candidate Levy MWANAWASA. MWANAWASA was reelected in 2006 in an election that was deemed free and fair. Upon his abrupt death in August 2008, he was succeeded by his vice president, Rupiah BANDA, who subsequently won a special presidential byelection in October 2008.

Privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly increased copper mining output and profitability to spur economic growth. Copper output has increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices and foreign investment. In 2005, Zambia qualified for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative, consisting of approximately US$6 billion in debt relief. Poverty remains a significant problem in Zambia, despite a stronger economy. Zambia's dependency on copper makes it vulnerable to depressed commodity prices, but record high copper prices and a bumper maize crop in 2010 helped Zambia rebound quickly from the world economic slowdown that began in 2008. Zambia has made some strides to improve the ease of doing business. A high birth rate, relatively high HIV/AIDS burden, and market distorting agricultural policies have meant that Zambia''s economic growth has not dramatically decreased the stubbornly high poverty rate."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$24.36 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 124 $22.7 billion (2011 est.) $21.24 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$20.52 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"7.3% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 28 6.8% (2011 est.) 7.6% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$1,700 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 198 $1,700 (2011 est.) $1,600 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"19.4% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 78 23.7% of GDP (2011 est.) 26.9% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 58.8% government consumption: 26.7% investment in fixed capital: 19.2% investment in inventories: 1.1% exports of goods and services: 36% imports of goods and services: -41.8% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 20.5% industry: 33.3% services: 46.3% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"corn, sorghum, rice, peanuts, sunflower seed, vegetables, flowers, tobacco, cotton, sugarcane, cassava (tapioca), coffee;
