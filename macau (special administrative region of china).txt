Macau's gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by China''s decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens wishing to visit Macau. By 2006, Macau''s gaming revenue surpassed that of the Las Vegas strip, and gaming-related taxes accounted for more than 70% of total government revenue. Macau''s economy slowed dramatically in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown, but strong growth resumed in 2010-11, largely on the back of tourism from mainland China and the gaming sectors. In 2012, this city of 582,000 hosted nearly 28 million visitors. Almost 60% came from mainland China. Macau''s traditional manufacturing industry has slowed greatly since the termination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. China is Macau''s second largest goods export market, behind Hong Kong, and followed by the United States. In 2012, exports were less than US$1 billion, while gaming receipts were US$38 billion, a 13.5% increase over 2011. Macau''s economy expanded by 10% in 2012; although impressive, it was a slower growth rate than in previous years. Macau continues to face the challenges of managing its growing casino industry, money-laundering, and the need to diversify the economy away from heavy dependence on gaming revenues. Macau''s currency, the pataca, is closely tied to the Hong Kong dollar, which is also freely accepted in the territory."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$47.19 billion (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 97 $42.9 billion (2011 est.) $39 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$44.3 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"10% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 9 20.7% (2011 est.) 27% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$82,400 (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 4 $75,500 (2010 est.) $69,700 (2009 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 19.9% government consumption: 6.8% investment in fixed capital: 13.4% investment in inventories: 1.4% exports of goods and services: 108.3% imports of goods and services: -49.7% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 0% industry: 6.3% services: 93.7% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"only 2% of land area is cultivated, mainly by vegetable growers;
