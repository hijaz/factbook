{"africa":{"western sahara":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Western Sahara is a disputed territory on the northwest coast of Africa bordered by Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria. After Spain withdrew from its former colony of Spanish Sahara in 1976, Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara and claimed the rest of the territory in 1979, following Mauritania's withdrawal. A guerrilla war with the Polisario Front contesting Morocco's sovereignty ended in a 1991 cease-fire and the establishment of a UN peacekeeping operation. As part of this effort, the UN sought to offer a choice to the peoples of the Western Sahara between independence (favored by the Polisario Front) or integration into Morocco. A proposed referendum never took place due to lack of agreement on voter eligibility. The 2,700 km- (1,700 mi-) long defensive sand berm, built by the Moroccans from 1980 to 1987 and running the length of the territory, continues to separate the opposing forces with Morocco controlling the roughly 80 percent of the territory west of the berm. Ethnic tensions in Western Sahara occasionally erupt into violence requiring a Moroccan security force response."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Northern Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Mauritania and Morocco"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"24 30 N, 13 00 W"},"map references":{"value":"Africa"},"area":{"value":"total: 266,000 sq km country comparison to the world: 78 land: 266,000 sq km water: 0 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"about the size of Colorado"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 2,046 km border countries: Algeria 42 km, Mauritania 1,561 km, Morocco 443 km"},"coastline":{"value":"1,110 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"contingent upon resolution of sovereignty issue"},"climate":{"value":"hot, dry desert;

Western Sahara''s unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between Morocco and the Polisario. Morocco and the EU in July 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing European vessels to fish off the coast of Morocco, including the disputed waters off the coast of Western Sahara, but this agreement was terminated in 2011. Oil has never been found in Western Sahara in commercially significant quantities, but Morocco and the Polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory.
