{"europe":{"albania":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, but was conquered by Italy in 1939. Communist partisans took over the country in 1944. Albania allied itself first with the USSR (until 1960), and then with China (to 1978). In the early 1990s, Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic communist rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, dilapidated infrastructure, powerful organized crime networks, and combative political opponents. Albania has made progress in its democratic development since first holding multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain. International observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997; however, each of Albania's post-communist elections have been marred by claims of electoral fraud. The 2009 general elections resulted in a coalition government, the first such in the country's history. Albania joined NATO in April 2009 and is a potential candidate for EU accession. Although Albania's economy continues to grow, the country is still one of the poorest in Europe, hampered by a large informal economy and an inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea and Ionian Sea, between Greece in the south and Montenegro and Kosovo to the north"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"41 00 N, 20 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 28,748 sq km country comparison to the world: 145 land: 27,398 sq km water: 1,350 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than Maryland"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 717 km border countries: Greece 282 km, Macedonia 151 km, Montenegro 172 km, Kosovo 112 km"},"coastline":{"value":"362 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm continental shelf: 200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"climate":{"value":"mild temperate;

Macroeconomic growth averaged around 6% between 2004-08, but declined to about 3% in 2009-11, and 0.5% in 2012. Inflation is low and stable. The government has taken measures to curb violent crime, and recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the large gray economy and attracting foreign investment. Remittances, a significant catalyst for economic growth declined from 12-15% of GDP before the 2008 financial crisis to 8% of GDP in 2010, mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy. The agricultural sector, which accounts for almost half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP, is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because of lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights, and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land. Energy shortages because of a reliance on hydropower - 98% of the electrical power produced in Albania - and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania's poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new foreign investment needed to expand the country's export base. FDI is among the lowest in the region, but the government has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms. The completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has helped diversify generation capacity, and plans to upgrade transmission lines between Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy shortages. Also, with help from EU funds, the government is taking steps to improve the poor national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth. The country will continue to face challenges from increasing public debt, having slightly exceeded its former statutory limit of 60% of GDP in 2012. Strong trade, remittance, and banking sector ties with Greece and Italy make Albania vulnerable to spillover effects of the global financial crisis."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$26.54 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 121 $26.2 billion (2011 est.) $25.44 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars Albania has an informal, and unreported, sector that may be as large as 50% of official GDP"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$12.69 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"1.3% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 147 3% (2011 est.) 3.5% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$8,200 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 131 $8,100 (2011 est.) $7,900 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"14.4% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 107 12.6% of GDP (2011 est.) 14.4% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 87.3% government consumption: 8.1% investment in fixed capital: 24.9% investment in inventories: 0% exports of goods and services: 34.4% imports of goods and services: -54.6% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 18% industry: 15.4% services: 66.5% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"wheat, corn, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, sugar beets, grapes;
