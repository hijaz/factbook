{"africa":{"zimbabwe":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"The UK annexed Southern Rhodesia from the [British] South Africa Company in 1923. A 1961 constitution was formulated that favored whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its independence, but the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more complete voting rights for the black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister, has been the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has dominated the country's political system since independence. His chaotic land redistribution campaign, which began in 2000, caused an exodus of white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation, MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure his reelection. In April 2005, the capital city of Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order, ostensibly an urban rationalization program, which resulted in the destruction of the homes or businesses of 700,000 mostly poor supporters of the opposition. President MUGABE in June 2007 instituted price controls on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store shelves empty for months. General elections held in March 2008 contained irregularities but still amounted to a censure of the ZANU-PF-led government with the opposition winning a majority of seats in parliament. MDC opposition leader Morgan TSVANGIRAI won the most votes in the presidential polls, but not enough to win outright. In the lead up to a run-off election in late June 2008, considerable violence enacted against opposition party members led to the withdrawal of TSVANGIRAI from the ballot. Extensive evidence of violence and intimidation resulted in international condemnation of the process. Difficult negotiations over a power-sharing government, in which MUGABE remained president and TSVANGIRAI became prime minister, were finally settled in February 2009, although the leaders failed to agree upon many key outstanding governmental issues. MUGABE was reelected president in June 2013 in balloting that was severely flawed and internationally condemned."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Southern Africa, between South Africa and Zambia"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"20 00 S, 30 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Africa"},"area":{"value":"total: 390,757 sq km country comparison to the world: 61 land: 386,847 sq km water: 3,910 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly larger than Montana"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 3,066 km border countries: Botswana 813 km, Mozambique 1,231 km, South Africa 225 km, Zambia 797 km"},"coastline":{"value":"0 km (landlocked)"},"maritime claims":{"value":"none (landlocked)"},"climate":{"value":"tropical;

Following a decade of contraction from 1998 to 2008, Zimbabwe's economy recorded real growth of more than 9% per year in 2010-11, before slowing to 5% in 2012, due in part to a poor harvest and low diamond revenues. However, the government of Zimbabwe still faces a number of difficult economic problems, including infrastructure and regulatory deficiencies, ongoing indigenization pressure, policy uncertainty, a large external debt burden, and insufficient formal employment. Zimbabwe''s 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy. The government''s subsequent land reform program, characterized by chaos and violence, badly damaged the commercial farming sector, the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs, turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products. Until early 2009, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit, causing hyperinflation. Dollarization in early 2009 - which allowed currencies such as the Botswana pula, the South Africa rand, and the US dollar to be used locally - ended hyperinflation and reduced inflation to about 10%, but exposed structural weaknesses that continue to inhibit broad-based growth."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$7.366 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 158 $7.054 billion (2011 est.) $6.38 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$9.802 billion note: in 2009, the Zimbabwean dollar was taken out of circulation, making Zimbabwe's GDP at the official exchange rate a highly inaccurate statistic (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"4.4% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 80 10.6% (2011 est.) 9.6% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$600 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 226 $500 (2011 est.) $500 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 68% government consumption: 29.4% investment in fixed capital: 21.9% exports of goods and services: 67.9% imports of goods and services: -87.1% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 20.3% industry: 25.1% services: 54.6% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"corn, cotton, tobacco, wheat, coffee, sugarcane, peanuts;
