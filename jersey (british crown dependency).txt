The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export income earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU countries. Tourism accounts for one-quarter of GDP. In recent years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey with the result that an electronics industry has developed, displacing more traditional industries. All raw material and energy requirements are imported as well as a large share of Jersey''s food needs. Light taxes and death duties make the island a popular tax haven. In January 2013, Jersey signed a tax agreement with Guernsey and the Isle of Man, in order to enable the islands'' authorities to end tax avoidance and evasion. Living standards come close to those of the UK."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$5.1 billion (2005 est.) country comparison to the world: 169"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$5.1 billion (2005 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"NA%"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$57,000 (2005 est.) country comparison to the world: 8"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 2% industry: 2% services: 96% (2010)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes; beef, dairy products"},"industries":{"value":"tourism, banking and finance, dairy, electronics"},"industrial production growth rate":{"value":"NA%"},"labor force":{"value":"53,380 (June 2012) country comparison to the world: 187"},"unemployment rate":{"value":"1.7% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 8 2.2% (2006 est.)"},"population below poverty line":{"value":"NA%"},"household income or consumption by percentage share":{"value":"lowest 10%: NA% highest 10%: NA%"},"budget":{"value":"revenues: $829 million expenditures: $851 million (2005)"},"taxes and other revenues":{"value":"16.3% of GDP (2005) country comparison to the world: 186"},"budget surplus (+) or deficit (-)":{"value":"-0.4% of GDP (2005) country comparison to the world: 55"},"fiscal year":{"value":"1 April - 31 March"},"inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"value":"3.7% (2006) country comparison to the world: 113"},"market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"exports":{"value":"$NA"},"exports - commodities":{"value":"light industrial and electrical goods, dairy cattle, foodstuffs, textiles, flowers"},"imports":{"value":"$NA"},"imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, foodstuffs, mineral fuels, chemicals"},"debt - external":{"value":"$NA"},"exchange rates":{"value":"Jersey pounds (JEP) per US dollar 0.63 (2012) 0.62 (2011) 0.65 (2010) 0.62 (2009) 0.53 (2008)"}},"energy":{"electricity - consumption":{"value":"630.1 million kWh (2004 est.) country comparison to the world: 162"}},"communications":{"telephones - main lines in use":{"value":"73,800 (2010) country comparison to the world: 153"},"telephones - mobile cellular":{"value":"108,000 (2010) country comparison to the world: 192"},"telephone system":{"value":"general assessment: increasingly modern system, with broadband access domestic: digital telephone system launch announced in 2006 now implemented; fixed-line and mobile-cellular services widely available; combined fixed and mobile-cellular density exceeds 100 per 100 persons international: country code - 44; submarine cable connectivity to Guernsey, the UK, and France (2010)"},"broadcast media":{"value":"multiple UK terrestrial television broadcasts are received via a transmitter in Jersey; satellite packages available; BBC Radio Jersey and 1 other radio station operating (2009)"},"internet country code":{"value":".je"},"internet hosts":{"value":"264 (2012) country comparison to the world: 193"},"internet users":{"value":"29,500 (2009) country comparison to the world: 182"}},"transportation":{"airports":{"value":"1 (2013) country comparison to the world: 221"},"airports - with paved runways":{"value":"total: 1 1,524 to 2,437 m: 1 (2013)"},"roadways":{"value":"total: 576 km (2010) country comparison to the world: 191"},"merchant marine":{"value":"registered in other countries: 14 (Gibraltar 1, India 2, Marshall Islands 11) (2010) country comparison to the world: 103"},"ports and terminals":{"value":"Gorey, Saint Aubin, Saint Helier"}},"military":{"manpower fit for military service":{"value":"males age 16-49: 18,688 females age 16-49: 18,615 (2010 est.)"},"manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"value":"male: 664 female: 590 (2010 est.)"},"military - note":{"value":"defense is the responsibility of the UK"}},"transnational issues":{"disputes - international":{"value":"none"}}}}}
