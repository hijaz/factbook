Mining accounts for 8% of GDP, but provides more than 50% of foreign exchange earnings. Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Marine diamond mining is becoming increasingly important as the terrestrial diamond supply has dwindled. Namibia is the world's fourth-largest producer of uranium. It also produces large quantities of zinc and is a small producer of gold and other minerals. The mining sector employs only about 3% of the population. Namibia normally imports about 50% of its cereal requirements; in drought years food shortages are a major problem in rural areas. A high per capita GDP, relative to the region, hides one of the world's most unequal income distributions, as shown by Namibia''s 59.7 GINI coefficient. The Namibian economy is closely linked to South Africa with the Namibian dollar pegged one-to-one to the South African rand. Namibia receives 30%-40% of its revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Volatility in the size of Namibia''s annual SACU allotment complicates budget planning. Namibia''s economy remains vulnerable to volatility in the price of uranium. The rising cost of mining diamonds, increasingly from the sea, has reduced profit margins. Namibian authorities recognize these issues and have emphasized the need to increase higher value raw materials, manufacturing, and services, especially in the logistics and transportation sectors."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$17.03 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 138 $16.37 billion (2011 est.) $15.61 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$12.3 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"4% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 69 4.8% (2011 est.) 6.6% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$7,900 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 134 $7,700 (2011 est.) $7,400 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"18.1% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 84 15.3% of GDP (2011 est.) 19% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 59.4% government consumption: 25.3% investment in fixed capital: 21.2% investment in inventories: 0.1% exports of goods and services: 42.9% imports of goods and services: -49% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 7.9% industry: 29.4% services: 62.7% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"millet, sorghum, peanuts, grapes;

the governments of South Africa and Namibia have not signed or ratified the text of the 1994 Surveyor's General agreement placing the boundary in the middle of the Orange River; Namibia has supported, and in 2004 Zimbabwe dropped objections to, plans between Botswana and Zambia to build a bridge over the Zambezi River, thereby de facto recognizing a short, but not clearly delimited, Botswana-Zambia boundary in the river"},"trafficking in persons":{"value":"current situation: Namibia is predominantly a country of origin and destination for children and, to a lesser extent, women subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; victims lured by promises of legitimate jobs are forced to work in hazardous condition in urban centers and on commercial farms; traffickers exploit Namibian children, as well as children from Angola, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, for forced labor in agriculture, cattle herding, domestic service, and criminal activities; children are also forced into prostitution, often catering to tourists from southern Africa and Europe; girls of the San tribe are particularly vulnerable tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Namibia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in 2012, the government launched a National Plan of Action on Gender-Based Violence, which included addressing human trafficking but did not complete its draft comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation or obtain parliamentary passage of the Child Care and Protection Bill, which would criminalize child trafficking; a process has been developed for referring trafficking victims for assistance but a system for screening potential victims and providing official designation of trafficking victim status is lacking (2013)"}}}}}
