{"africa":{"kenya":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA led Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when President Daniel MOI took power in a constitutional succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969 until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and fraud, but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption platform. KIBAKI's NARC coalition splintered in 2005 over a constitutional review process. Government defectors joined with KANU to form a new opposition coalition, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), which defeated the government's draft constitution in a popular referendum in November 2005. KIBAKI's reelection in December 2007 brought charges of vote rigging from ODM candidate Raila ODINGA and unleashed two months of violence in which as many as 1,500 people died. African Union-sponsored mediation led by former UN Secretary General Kofi ANNAN in late February 2008 resulted in a power-sharing accord bringing ODINGA into the government in the restored position of prime minister. The power sharing accord included a broad reform agenda, the centerpiece of which was constitutional reform. In August 2010, Kenyans overwhelmingly adopted a new constitution in a national referendum. The new constitution introduced additional checks and balances to executive power and significant devolution of power and resources to 47 newly created counties. It also eliminated the position of prime minister following the first presidential election under the new constitution, which occurred on 4 March 2013. Uhuru KENYATTA, the son of founding president Jomo KENYATTA, won the March elections in the first round by a close margin and was sworn into office on 9 April 2013."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Eastern Africa, bordering the Indian Ocean, between Somalia and Tanzania"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"1 00 N, 38 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Africa"},"area":{"value":"total: 580,367 sq km country comparison to the world: 49 land: 569,140 sq km water: 11,227 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly more than twice the size of Nevada"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 3,477 km border countries: Ethiopia 861 km, Somalia 682 km, South Sudan 232 km, Tanzania 769 km, Uganda 933 km"},"coastline":{"value":"536 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm exclusive economic zone: 200 nm continental shelf: 200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"climate":{"value":"varies from tropical along coast to arid in interior"},"terrain":{"value":"low plains rise to central highlands bisected by Great Rift Valley;

Low infrastructure investment threatens Kenya's long-term position as the largest East African economy. In the key December 2002 elections, Daniel MOI's 24-year-old reign ended, and a new opposition government took on the formidable economic problems facing the nation. After some early progress in rooting out corruption and encouraging donor support, the KIBAKI government was rocked by high-level graft scandals in 2005 and 2006. In 2006, the World Bank and IMF delayed loans pending action by the government on corruption. The international financial institutions and donors have since resumed lending, despite little action on the government''s part to deal with corruption. Unemployment is very high. The country has experienced chronic budget deficits, inflationary pressures, and sharp currency depreciation - as a result of high food and fuel import prices. The discovery of oil in March 2012 provides an opportunity for Kenya to balance its growing trade deficit if the deposits are found to be commercially viable and Kenya is able to develop a port and pipeline to export its oil."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$77.14 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 83 $73.67 billion (2011 est.) $70.58 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$41.12 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"4.7% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 76 4.4% (2011 est.) 5.8% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$1,800 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 196 $1,800 (2011 est.) $1,800 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"9.5% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 126 10.8% of GDP (2011 est.) 12.4% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 79.8% government consumption: 17.2% investment in fixed capital: 20.4% investment in inventories: -0.3% exports of goods and services: 27.3% imports of goods and services: -44.5% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 29.3% industry: 17.4% services: 53.6% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"tea, coffee, corn, wheat, sugarcane, fruit, vegetables; dairy products, beef, pork, poultry, eggs"},"industries":{"value":"small-scale consumer goods (plastic, furniture, batteries, textiles, clothing, soap, cigarettes, flour), agricultural products, horticulture, oil refining; aluminum, steel, lead; cement, commercial ship repair, tourism"},"industrial production growth rate":{"value":"4.5% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 66"},"labor force":{"value":"19.11 million (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 31"},"labor force - by occupation":{"value":"agriculture: 75% industry and services: 25% (2007 est.)"},"unemployment rate":{"value":"40% (2008 est.) country comparison to the world: 187 40% (2001 est.)"},"population below poverty line":{"value":"50% (2000 est.)"},"household income or consumption by percentage share":{"value":"lowest 10%: 1.8% highest 10%: 37.8% (2005)"},"distribution of family income - gini index":{"value":"42.5 (2008 est.) country comparison to the world: 49 44.9 (1997)"},"budget":{"value":"revenues: $7.418 billion expenditures: $9.485 billion (2012 est.)"},"taxes and other revenues":{"value":"18% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 175"},"budget surplus (+) or deficit (-)":{"value":"-5% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 170"},"public debt":{"value":"52.5% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 56 53.4% of GDP (2011 est.)"},"fiscal year":{"value":"1 July - 30 June"},"inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"value":"9.4% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 195 14% (2011 est.)"},"central bank discount rate":{"value":"7% (31 December 2010 est.)
