Government is a major employer of the work force relying on financial assistance from the US under the Compact of Free Association (Compact) with the US. The Compact took effect, after the end of the UN trusteeship on 1 October 1994. The US provided Palau with roughly $700 million in aid for the first 15 years following commencement of the Compact in 1994 in return for unrestricted access to its land and waterways for strategic purposes. Business and leisure tourist arrivals numbered over 109,000 in 2011, for a 27% increase over 2010. The population enjoys a per capita income roughly double that of the Philippines and much of Micronesia. Long-run prospects for tourism have been bolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific, the rising prosperity of industrial East Asia, and the willingness of foreigners to finance infrastructure development. Proximity to Guam, the region's major destination for tourists from East Asia, and a regionally competitive tourist infrastructure enhance Palau's advantage as a destination."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$221 million (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 218 $208.9 million (2010 est.) note: GDP estimate includes US subsidy"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$221 million (2011 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"5.8% (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 39 5.5% (2005 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$10,500 (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 114 $7,600 (2005 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 3.2% industry: 20% services: 76.8% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"coconuts, copra, cassava (tapioca), sweet potatoes; fish"},"industries":{"value":"tourism, craft items (from shell, wood, pearls), construction, garment making"},"industrial production growth rate":{"value":"NA%"},"labor force":{"value":"9,777 (2005) country comparison to the world: 217"},"labor force - by occupation":{"value":"agriculture: 20% industry: NA% services: NA% (1990)"},"unemployment rate":{"value":"4.2% (2005 est.) country comparison to the world: 36"},"population below poverty line":{"value":"NA%"},"household income or consumption by percentage share":{"value":"lowest 10%: NA% highest 10%: NA%"},"budget":{"value":"revenues: $89 million expenditures: $94.3 million (2010 est.)"},"taxes and other revenues":{"value":"40.3% of GDP (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 45"},"budget surplus (+) or deficit (-)":{"value":"-2.4% of GDP (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 97"},"fiscal year":{"value":"1 October - 30 September"},"inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"value":"2.7% (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 79 1.6% (2010 est.)"},"market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"current account balance":{"value":"-$20.8 million (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 60 $15.09 million (FY03/04)"},"exports":{"value":"$12.3 million (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 208 $5.882 million (2004 est.)"},"exports - commodities":{"value":"shellfish, tuna, copra, garments"},"imports":{"value":"$113.4 million (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 212 $107.3 million (2004 est.)"},"imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, fuels, metals; foodstuffs"},"debt - external":{"value":"$0 (FY99/00) country comparison to the world: 202"},"exchange rates":{"value":"the US dollar is used"}},"communications":{"telephones - main lines in use":{"value":"7,300 (2012) country comparison to the world: 205"},"telephones - mobile cellular":{"value":"17,150 (2012) country comparison to the world: 210"},"telephone system":{"value":"domestic: fixed-line and mobile-cellular services available with a combined subscribership of roughly 100 per 100 persons international: country code - 680; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean) (2009)"},"broadcast media":{"value":"no TV stations; a cable TV network covers the major islands and provides access to rebroadcasts, on a delayed basis, of a number of US stations as well as access to a number of real-time satellite TV channels; about a half dozen radio stations with 1 government-owned (2009)"},"internet country code":{"value":".pw"},"internet hosts":{"value":"4 (2012) country comparison to the world: 231"}},"transportation":{"airports":{"value":"3 (2013) country comparison to the world: 194"},"airports - with paved runways":{"value":"total: 1 1,524 to 2,437 m: 1 (2013)"},"airports - with unpaved runways":{"value":"total: 2 1,524 to 2,437 m: 2 (2013)"},"ports and terminals":{"value":"Koror"}},"military":{"military branches":{"value":"no regular military forces; Palau National Police (2009)"},"manpower available for military service":{"value":"males age 16-49: 6,987 (2010 est.)"},"manpower fit for military service":{"value":"males age 16-49: 5,272 females age 16-49: 3,969 (2010 est.)"},"manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"value":"male: 216 female: 222 (2010 est.)"},"military expenditures":{"value":"NA"},"military - note":{"value":"defense is the responsibility of the US; under a Compact of Free Association between Palau and the US, the US military is granted access to the islands for 50 years, but it has not stationed any military forces there (2008)"}},"transnational issues":{"disputes - international":{"value":"maritime delineation negotiations continue with Philippines, Indonesia"}}}}}
