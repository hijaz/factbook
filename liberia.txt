{"africa":{"liberia":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Settlement of freed slaves from the US in what is today Liberia began in 1822; by 1847, the Americo-Liberians were able to establish a republic. William TUBMAN, president from 1944-71, did much to promote foreign investment and to bridge the economic, social, and political gaps between the descendants of the original settlers and the inhabitants of the interior. In 1980, a military coup led by Samuel DOE ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In December 1989, Charles TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE's regime that led to a prolonged civil war in which DOE was killed. A period of relative peace in 1997 allowed for elections that brought TAYLOR to power, but major fighting resumed in 2000. An August 2003 peace agreement ended the war and prompted the resignation of former president Charles TAYLOR, who faces war crimes charges in The Hague related to his involvement in Sierra Leone's civil war. After two years of rule by a transitional government, democratic elections in late 2005 brought President Ellen JOHNSON SIRLEAF to power. She subsequently won reelection in 2011 in a second round vote that was boycotted by the opposition and remains challenged to build Liberia's economy and reconcile a nation still recovering from 14 years of fighting. The United Nations Security Council in September 2012 passed Resolution 2066 which calls for a reduction of UN troops in Liberia by half by 2015, bringing the troop total down to fewer than 4000, and challenging Liberia's security sector to fill the gaps."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Cote d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"6 30 N, 9 30 W"},"map references":{"value":"Africa"},"area":{"value":"total: 111,369 sq km country comparison to the world: 104 land: 96,320 sq km water: 15,049 sq km"},"area -

Civil war and government mismanagement destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure in and around the capital, Monrovia. Many businesses fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them, but with the conclusion of fighting and the installation of a democratically elected government in 2006, several have returned. Liberia has the distinction of having the highest ratio of direct foreign investment to GDP in the world. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products, primarily raw timber and rubber and is reviving those sectors. Local manufacturing, mainly foreign-owned, had been small in scope. President JOHNSON SIRLEAF, a Harvard-trained banker and administrator, has taken steps to reduce corruption, build support from international donors, and encourage private investment. Embargos on timber and diamond exports have been lifted, opening new sources of revenue for the government and Liberia shipped its first major timber exports to Europe in 2010. The country reached its Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative completion point in 2010, and nearly $5 billion of international debt was permanently eliminated. This new status will enable Liberia to establish a sovereign credit rating and issue bonds. Liberia's Paris Club creditors agreed to cancel Liberia's debt as well. The IMF has completed the sixth review of Liberia's extended credit facility, bringing total disbursements to over $379 million. The African Development Bank approved a grant of $48 million in 2011 to support economic governance and competitiveness. Rebuilding infrastructure and raising incomes will depend on generous financial and technical assistance from donor countries and foreign investment in key sectors, such as infrastructure and power generation. The country has achieved high growth during 2010-12 due to favorable world prices for its commodities."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$2.719 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 185 $2.509 billion (2011 est.) $2.326 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$1.735 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"8.3% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 17 7.9% (2011 est.) 6.1% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$700 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 222 $600 (2011 est.) $600 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"NA (2012 est.) -36.6% of GDP (2011 est.) -30.6% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 125.6% government consumption: 15.2% investment in fixed capital: 25% investment in inventories: 0% exports of goods and services: 27.5% imports of goods and services: -93.3% (2011 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 76.9% industry: 5.4% services: 17.7% (2002 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"rubber, coffee, cocoa, rice, cassava (manioc), palm oil, sugarcane, bananas;
