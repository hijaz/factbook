After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay went their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina. The country's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants from throughout Europe, with Italy and Spain providing the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up until about the mid-20th century, much of Argentina's history was dominated by periods of internal political conflict between Federalists and Unitarians and between civilian and military factions. After World War II, an era of Peronist populism and direct and indirect military interference in subsequent governments was followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983 after a failed bid to seize the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) by force, and has persisted despite numerous challenges, the most formidable of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent public protests and the successive resignations of several presidents.

Argentina's fertility decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1950s and then becoming more gradual. Life expectancy has been improving, most notably among the young and the poor. While the population under age 15 is shrinking, the youth cohort - ages 15-24 - is the largest in Argentina's history and will continue to bolster the working-age population. If this large working-age population is well-educated and gainfully employed, Argentina is likely to experience an economic boost and possibly higher per capita savings and investment. Although literacy and primary school enrollment are nearly universal, grade repetition is problematic and secondary school completion is low. Both of these issues vary widely by region and socioeconomic group. Argentina has been primarily a country of immigration for most of its history, welcoming European immigrants after its independence in the 19th century and attracting especially large numbers from Spain and Italy. European immigration diminished in the 1950s, when Argentina's military dictatorships tightened immigration rules and European economies rebounded. Regional migration, however, continued to supply low-skilled workers and today it accounts for three-quarters of Argentina's immigrant population. The first waves of highly skilled Argentine emigrant workers headed mainly to the United States and Spain in the 1960s and 1970s. The ongoing European economic crisis is driving the return migration of some Argentinean and other Latin American nationals, as well as the immigration of Europeans to South America, where Argentina is a key recipient."},"population":{"value":"42,610,981 (July 2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 33"},"age structure":{"value":"0-14 years: 25.1% (male 5,468,773/female 5,217,256) 15-24 years: 15.8% (male 3,436,816/female 3,296,788) 25-54 years: 38.8% (male 8,238,184/female 8,290,649) 55-64 years: 9.1% (male 1,871,644/female 1,990,790) 65 years and over: 11.3% (male 1,987,344/female 2,812,737) (2013 est.) population pyramid:"},"dependency ratios":{"value":"total dependency ratio: 54.3 % youth dependency ratio: 37.4 % elderly dependency ratio: 16.9 % potential support ratio: 5.9 (2013)"},"median age":{"value":"total: 31 years male: 29.9 years female: 32.1 years (2013 est.)"},"population growth rate":{"value":"0.98% (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 119"},"birth rate":{"value":"17.12 births/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 114"},"death rate":{"value":"7.35 deaths/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 121"},"net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 76"},"urbanization":{"value":"urban population: 92% of total population (2010) rate of urbanization: 1.1% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"major urban areas - population":{"value":"BUENOS AIRES (capital) 13.528 million;

Although one of the world's wealthiest countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt, and capital flight. A severe depression, growing public and external indebtedness, and an unprecedented bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious economic, social, and political crisis in the country's turbulent history. Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default - at the time the largest ever - on the government's foreign debt in December of that year, and abruptly resigned only a few days after taking office. His successor, Eduardo DUHALDE, announced an end to the peso's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002. The economy bottomed out that year, with real GDP 18% smaller than in 1998 and almost 60% of Argentines under the poverty line. Real GDP rebounded to grow by an average 8.5% annually over the subsequent six years, taking advantage of previously idled industrial capacity and labor, an audacious debt restructuring and reduced debt burden, excellent international financial conditions, and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. Inflation also increased, however, during the administration of President Nestor KIRCHNER, which responded with price restraints on businesses, as well as export taxes and restraints, and beginning in 2007, with understating inflation data. Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as President in late 2007, and the rapid economic growth of previous years began to slow sharply the following year as government policies held back exports and the world economy fell into recession. The economy in 2010 rebounded strongly from the 2009 recession, but has slowed since late 2011 even as the government continued to rely on expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, which have kept inflation in the double digits. The government expanded state intervention in the economy throughout 2012. In May the Congress approved the nationalization of the oil company YPF from Spain's Repsol. The government expanded formal and informal measures to restrict imports during the year, including a requirement for pre-registration and pre-approval of all imports. In July the government also further tightened currency controls in an effort to bolster foreign reserves and stem capital flight."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$755.3 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 23 $741.3 billion (2011 est.) $680.9 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$475 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
