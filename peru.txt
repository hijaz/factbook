{"south america":{"peru":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean civilizations, most notably that of the Incas whose empire was captured by Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peruvian independence was declared in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces were defeated in 1824. After a dozen years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic leadership in 1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless, the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime, which led to his ouster in 2000. A caretaker government oversaw new elections in the spring of 2001, which installed Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of government - Peru's first democratically elected president of indigenous Quechuan ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the return of Alan GARCIA Perez who, after a disappointing presidential term from 1985 to 1990, oversaw a robust economic rebound. In June 2011, former army officer Ollanta HUMALA Tasso was elected president, defeating Keiko FUJIMORI Higuchi, the daughter of Alberto FUJIMORI. Since his election, HUMALA has carried on the sound, market-oriented economic policies of the three preceding administrations."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Western South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean, between Chile and Ecuador"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"10 00 S, 76 00 W"},"map references":{"value":"South America"},"area":{"value":"total: 1,285,216 sq km country comparison to the world: 20 land: 1,279,996 sq km water: 5,220 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than Alaska"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 7,461 km border countries: Bolivia 1,075 km, Brazil 2,995 km, Chile 171 km, Colombia 1,800 km, Ecuador 1,420 km"},"coastline":{"value":"2,414 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 200 nm continental shelf: 200 nm"},"climate":{"value":"varies from tropical in east to dry desert in west; temperate to frigid in Andes"},"terrain":{"value":"western coastal plain (costa), high and rugged Andes in center (sierra), eastern lowland jungle of Amazon Basin (selva)"},"elevation extremes":{"value":"lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m highest point: Nevado Huascaran 6,768 m"},"natural resources":{"value":"copper, silver, gold, petroleum, timber, fish, iron ore, coal, phosphate, potash, hydropower, natural gas"},"land use":{"value":"arable land: 2.84% permanent crops: 0.66% other: 96.5% (2011)"},"irrigated land":{"value":"11,960 sq km (2003)"},"total renewable water resources":{"value":"1,913 cu km (2011)"},"freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"value":"total: 19.34 cu km/yr (8%/10%/82%) per capita: 727.6 cu m/yr (2005)"},"natural hazards":{"value":"earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, landslides, mild volcanic activity volcanism: volcanic activity in the Andes Mountains; Ubinas (elev. 5,672 m), which last erupted in 2009, is the country's most active volcano; other historically active volcanoes include El Misti, Huaynaputina, Sabancaya, and Yucamane"},"environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation (some the result of illegal logging); overgrazing of the slopes of the costa and sierra leading to soil erosion; desertification; air pollution in Lima; pollution of rivers and coastal waters from municipal and mining wastes"},"environment - international agreements":{"value":"party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements"},"geography - note":{"value":"shares control of Lago Titicaca, world's highest navigable lake, with Bolivia; a remote slope of Nevado Mismi, a 5,316 m peak, is the ultimate source of the Amazon River"}},"people and society":{"nationality":{"value":"noun: Peruvian(s) adjective: Peruvian"},"ethnic groups":{"value":"Amerindian 45%, mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white) 37%, white 15%, black, Japanese, Chinese, and other 3%"},"languages":{"value":"Spanish (official) 84.1%, Quechua (official) 13%, Aymara (official) 1.7%, Ashaninka 0.3%, other native languages (includes a large number of minor Amazonian languages) 0.7%, other 0.2% (2007 Census)"},"religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 81.3%, Evangelical 12.5%, other 3.3%, unspecified or none 2.9% (2007 Census)"},"demographic profile":{"value":"Peru's urban and coastal communities have benefited much more from recent economic growth than rural, Afro-Peruvian, indigenous, and poor populations of the Amazon and mountain regions.

After remaining almost static for about a decade, Peru's malnutrition rate began falling in 2005, when the government introduced a coordinated strategy focusing on hygiene, sanitation, and clean water. School enrollment has improved, but achievement scores reflect ongoing problems with educational quality. Many poor children temporarily or permanently drop out of school to help support their families. About a quarter to a third of Peruvian children aged 6 to 14 work, often putting in long hours at hazardous mining or construction sites. Peru was a country of immigration in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but has become a country of emigration in the last few decades. Beginning in the 19th century, Peru brought in Asian contract laborers mainly to work on coastal plantations. Populations of Chinese and Japanese descent - among the largest in Latin America - are economically and culturally influential in Peru today. Peruvian emigration began rising in the 1980s due to an economic crisis and a violent internal conflict, but outflows have stabilized in the last few years as economic conditions have improved. Nonetheless, more than 2 million Peruvians have emigrated in the last decade, principally to the US, Spain, and Argentina."},"population":{"value":"29,849,303 (July 2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 43"},"age structure":{"value":"0-14 years: 27.6% (male 4,197,698/female 4,053,852) 15-24 years: 19.4% (male 2,894,420/female 2,891,714) 25-54 years: 39.2% (male 5,633,249/female 6,056,017) 55-64 years: 7.1% (male 1,039,975/female 1,086,428) 65 years and over: 6.7% (male 947,349/female 1,048,601) (2013 est.) population pyramid:"},"dependency ratios":{"value":"total dependency ratio: 54.2 % youth dependency ratio: 44.4 % elderly dependency ratio: 9.9 % potential support ratio: 10.1 (2013)"},"median age":{"value":"total: 26.7 years male: 26 years female: 27.4 years (2013 est.)"},"population growth rate":{"value":"1% (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 115"},"birth rate":{"value":"18.85 births/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 98"},"death rate":{"value":"5.97 deaths/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 165"},"net migration rate":{"value":"-2.86 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 174"},"urbanization":{"value":"urban population: 77% of total population (2010) rate of urbanization: 1.6% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"major urban areas - population":{"value":"LIMA (capital) 8.769 million;

A wide range of important mineral resources are found in the mountainous and coastal areas, and Peru's coastal waters provide excellent fishing grounds. The Peruvian economy has been growing by an average of 6.4% per year since 2002 with a stable/slightly appreciating exchange rate and low inflation, which in 2013 is expected to be below the upper limit of the Central Bank target range of 1 to 3%. Growth has been in the 6-9% range for the last three years, due partly to a leap in private investment, especially in the extractive sector, which accounts for more than 60% of Peru's total exports. Despite Peru's strong macroeconomic performance, dependence on minerals and metals exports and imported foodstuffs subjects the economy to fluctuations in world prices. Poor infrastructure hinders the spread of growth to Peru's non-coastal areas. Peru's rapid expansion coupled with cash transfers and other programs have helped to reduce the national poverty rate by 23 percentage points since 2002, but inequality persists and continues to pose a challenge for the new Ollanta HUMALA administration, which has championed a policy of social inclusion and a more equitable distribution of income. Peru's free trade policy has continued under the HUMALA administration; since 2006, Peru has signed trade deals with the US, Canada, Singapore, China, Korea, Mexico, Japan, the European Free Trade Association, Chile, and four other countries; concluded negotiations with Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Guatemala; and begun trade talks with two other Central American countries and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Peru also has signed a trade pact with Chile, Colombia, and Mexico called the Pacific Alliance that rivals Mercosur in combined population, GDP, and trade. The US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement entered into force 1 February 2009, opening the way to greater trade and investment between the two economies. Although Peru has continued to attract foreign investment, political activism and protests are hampering development of some projects related to natural resource extraction."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$332 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 41 $312.4 billion (2011 est.) $292.2 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$199 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"6.3% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 38 6.9% (2011 est.) 8.8% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$10,900 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 112 $10,400 (2011 est.) $9,900 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"23.3% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 57 23.4% of GDP (2011 est.) 22.7% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 61.9% government consumption: 10.3% investment in fixed capital: 26.6% investment in inventories: 0.3% exports of goods and services: 25.5% imports of goods and services: -24.5% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 6.3% industry: 37.6% services: 56.1% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"asparagus, coffee, cocoa, cotton, sugarcane, rice, potatoes, corn, plantains, grapes, oranges, pineapples, guavas, bananas, apples, lemons, pears, coca, tomatoes, mangoes, barley, medicinal plants, palm oil, marigold, onion, wheat, dry beans;
