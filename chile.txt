Although Chile declared its independence in 1810, decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-83), Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its present northern regions. It was not until the 1880s that the Mapuche were brought under central government control. After a series of elected governments, the three-year-old Marxist government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military coup led by Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a freely elected president was inaugurated in 1990. Sound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady growth, reduced poverty rates by over half, and have helped secure the country's commitment to democratic and representative government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and international leadership roles befitting its status as a stable, democratic nation."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Southern South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean, between Argentina and Peru"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"30 00 S, 71 00 W"},"map references":{"value":"South America"},"area":{"value":"total: 756,102 sq km country comparison to the world: 38 land: 743,812 sq km water: 12,290 sq km note: includes Easter Island (Isla de Pascua) and Isla Sala y Gomez"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than twice the size of Montana"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 6,339 km border countries: Argentina 5,308 km, Bolivia 860 km, Peru 171 km"},"coastline":{"value":"6,435 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm contiguous zone: 24 nm exclusive economic zone: 200 nm continental shelf: 200/350 nm"},"climate":{"value":"temperate; desert in north; Mediterranean in central region; cool and damp in south"},"terrain":{"value":"low coastal mountains; fertile central valley; rugged Andes in east"},"elevation extremes":{"value":"lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m highest point: Nevado Ojos del Salado 6,880 m"},"natural resources":{"value":"copper, timber, iron ore, nitrates, precious metals, molybdenum, hydropower"},"land use":{"value":"arable land: 1.74% permanent crops: 0.6% other: 97.65% (2011)"},"irrigated land":{"value":"11,990 sq km (2003)"},"total renewable water resources":{"value":"922 cu km (2011)"},"freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"value":"total: 26.67 cu km/yr (4%/10%/86%) per capita: 1,603 cu m/yr (2007)"},"natural hazards":{"value":"severe earthquakes; active volcanism; tsunamis volcanism: significant volcanic activity due to more than three-dozen active volcanoes along the Andes Mountains; Lascar (elev. 5,592 m), which last erupted in 2007, is the most active volcano in the northern Chilean Andes; Llaima (elev. 3,125 m) in central Chile, which last erupted in 2009, is another of the country's most active; Chaiten's 2008 eruption forced major evacuations; other notable historically active volcanoes include Cerro Hudson, Copahue, Guallatiri, Llullaillaco, Nevados de Chillan, Puyehue, San Pedro, and Villarrica"},"environment - current issues":{"value":"widespread deforestation and mining threaten natural resources; air pollution from industrial and vehicle emissions; water pollution from raw sewage"},"environment - international agreements":{"value":"party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements"},"geography - note":{"value":"the longest north-south trending country in the world, extending across 38 degrees of latitude; strategic location relative to sea lanes between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Strait of Magellan, Beagle Channel, Drake Passage); Atacama Desert - the driest desert in the world - spreads across the northern part of the country; the crater lake of Ojos del Salado is the world's highest lake (at 6,390 m)"}},"people and society":{"nationality":{"value":"noun: Chilean(s) adjective: Chilean"},"ethnic groups":{"value":"white and white-Amerindian 95.4%, Mapuche 4%, other indigenous groups 0.6% (2002 census)"},"languages":{"value":"Spanish (official), Mapudungun, German, English"},"religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 70%, Evangelical 15.1%, Jehovah's Witnesses 1.1%, other Christian 1%, other 4.6%, none 8.3% (2002 census)"},"demographic profile":{"value":"Chile is in the advanced stages of demographic transition and is becoming an aging society - with fertility below replacement level, low mortality rates, and life expectancy on par with developed countries.

Exports account for approximately one-third of GDP, with commodities making up some three-quarters of total exports. Copper alone provides 19% of government revenue. From 2003 through 2012, real growth averaged almost 5% per year, despite the slight contraction in 2009 that resulted from the global financial crisis. Chile deepened its longstanding commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of a free trade agreement with the US, which took effect on 1 January 2004. Chile has 22 trade agreements covering 60 countries including agreements with the European Union, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico. Chile has joined the United States and nine other countries in negotiating the Trans-Pacific-Partnership trade agreement. In 2012, foreign direct investment inflows reached $28.2 billion, an increase of 63% over the previous record set in 2011. The Chilean Government has generally followed a countercyclical fiscal policy, accumulating surpluses in sovereign wealth funds during periods of high copper prices and economic growth, and generally allowing deficit spending only during periods of low copper prices and growth. As of 31 December 2012, those sovereign wealth funds - kept mostly outside the country and separate from Central Bank reserves - amounted to more than $20.9 billion. Chile used these funds to finance fiscal stimulus packages during the 2009 economic downturn. In May 2010 Chile signed the OECD Convention, becoming the first South American country to join the OECD."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$325.8 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 42 $308.9 billion (2011 est.) $291.7 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$268.2 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
