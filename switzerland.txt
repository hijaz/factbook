{"europe":{"switzerland":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A constitution of 1848, subsequently modified in 1874, replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government. Switzerland's sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and the country was not involved in either of the two world wars. The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and international organizations but retains a strong commitment to neutrality."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Central Europe, east of France, north of Italy"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"47 00 N, 8 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 41,277 sq km country comparison to the world: 136 land: 39,997 sq km water: 1,280 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly less than twice the size of New Jersey"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 1,852 km border countries: Austria 164 km, France 573 km, Italy 740 km, Liechtenstein 41 km, Germany 334 km"},"coastline":{"value":"0 km (landlocked)"},"maritime claims":{"value":"none (landlocked)"},"climate":{"value":"temperate, but varies with altitude;

Switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector, led by financial services, and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology, knowledge-based production. Its economic and political stability, transparent legal system, exceptional infrastructure, efficient capital markets, and low corporate tax rates also make Switzerland one of the world's most competitive economies. The Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's to enhance their international competitiveness, but some trade protectionism remains, particularly for its small agricultural sector. The fate of the Swiss economy is tightly linked to that of its neighbors in the euro zone, which purchases half of all Swiss exports. The global financial crisis of 2008 and resulting economic downturn in 2009 stalled export demand and put Switzerland in a recession. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy to boost the economy as well as prevent appreciation of the franc, and Switzerland's economy recovered in 2010 with 3.0% growth. The sovereign debt crises currently unfolding in neighboring euro-zone countries pose a significant risk to Switzerland's financial stability and are driving up demand for the Swiss franc by investors seeking a safe-haven currency. The independent SNB has upheld its zero-interest rate policy and conducted major market interventions to prevent further appreciation of the Swiss franc, but parliamentarians have urged it to do more to weaken the currency. The franc's strength has made Swiss exports less competitive and weakened the country's growth outlook; GDP growth fell to 1.9% in 2011 and 0.8% in 2012. Switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries, the EU, the US, and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws. Consequently, the government agreed to conform to OECD regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters, including tax evasion. The government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries, including the US, to incorporate the OECD standard, and is considering the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners. These steps will have a lasting impact on Switzerland's long history of bank secrecy."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$369.4 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 37 $365.8 billion (2011 est.) $358.9 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$632.4 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"1% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 158 1.9% (2011 est.) 3% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$46,200 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 15 $46,000 (2011 est.) $45,600 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"31.5% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 21 27.3% of GDP (2011 est.) 34.2% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 57.4% government consumption: 11.2% investment in fixed capital: 20.1% investment in inventories: 0.9% exports of goods and services: 52.3% imports of goods and services: -41.9% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 0.7% industry: 26.8% services: 72.5% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"grains, fruits, vegetables;
