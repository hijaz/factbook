Coal mining is the dominant economic activity and a treaty of 9 February 1920 gave the 41 signatories equal rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies still engaging in this are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local services, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some hunting of seal, reindeer, and fox. Goods such as alcohol, tobacco, and vehicles, normally highly taxed on mainland Norway, are considerably cheaper in Svalbard in an effort by the Norwegian government to entice more people to live on the Arctic archipelago. By law, the Norwegians collect only enough taxes to pay for the needs of the local government; none of tax proceeds go to Norway."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$6.313 billion"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"NA%"},"labor force":{"value":"1,234 (2003) country comparison to the world: 229"},"budget":{"value":"revenues: $NA expenditures: $NA"},"taxes and other revenues":{"value":"NA% of GDP"},"budget surplus (+) or deficit (-)":{"value":"NA% of GDP"},"exports":{"value":"$NA"},"imports":{"value":"$NA"},"exchange rates":{"value":"Norwegian kroner (NOK) per US dollar - 5.82 (2012) 5.61 (2011) 6.04 (2010) 6.29 (2009) 5.64 (2008)"}},"communications":{"telephone system":{"value":"general assessment: adequate domestic: local telephone service international: country code - 47-790; satellite earth station - 1 of unknown type (for communication with Norwegian mainland only) (2005)"},"broadcast media":{"value":"the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) began direct TV transmission to Svalbard via satellite in 1984; Longyearbyen households have access to 3 NRK radio and 2 TV stations (2008)"},"internet country code":{"value":".sj"}},"transportation":{"airports":{"value":"4 (2013) country comparison to the world: 188"},"airports - with paved runways":{"value":"total: 1 2,438 to 3,047 m: 1 (2013)"},"airports - with unpaved runways":{"value":"total: 3 under 914 m: 3 (2013)"},"heliports":{"value":"1 (2013)"},"ports and terminals":{"value":"Barentsburg, Longyearbyen, Ny-Alesund, Pyramiden"}},"military":{"military branches":{"value":"no regular military forces"},"military - note":{"value":"Svalbard is a territory of Norway, demilitarized by treaty on 9 February 1920; Norwegian military activity is limited to fisheries surveillance by the Norwegian Coast Guard"}},"transnational issues":{"disputes - international":{"value":"despite recent discussions, Russia and Norway dispute their maritime limits in the Barents Sea and Russia's fishing rights beyond Svalbard's territorial limits within the Svalbard Treaty zone"}}}}}
