{"europe":{"spain":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused the country to fall behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic and political power. Spain remained neutral in World War I and II but suffered through a devastating civil war (1936-39). A peaceful transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco FRANCO in 1975, and rapid economic modernization (Spain joined the EU in 1986) gave Spain a dynamic and rapidly growing economy and made it a global champion of freedom and human rights. More recently the government has had to focus on measures to reverse a severe economic recession that began in mid-2008. Austerity measures implemented to reduce a large budget deficit and reassure foreign investors have led to one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Southwestern Europe, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, Bay of Biscay, and Pyrenees Mountains;

The economy has once again fallen into recession as deleveraging in the private sector, fiscal consolidation, and continued high unemployment weigh on domestic demand and investment, even as exports have shown signs of resiliency. The unemployment rate rose from a low of about 8% in 2007 to 26.0% in 2012. The economic downturn has also hurt Spain's public finances. The government budget deficit peaked at 11.2% of GDP in 2010 and the process to reduce this imbalance has been slow despite the central government's efforts to raise new tax revenue and cut spending. Spain reduced its budget deficit to 9.4% of GDP in 2011, and roughly 7.4% of GDP in 2012, above the 6.3% target negotiated between Spain and the EU. Although Spain''s large budget deficit and poor economic growth prospects remain a source of concern for foreign investors, the government''s ongoing efforts to cut spending and introduce flexibility into the labor markets are intended to assuage these concerns. The government is also taking steps to shore up the banking system, namely by using up to $130 billion in EU funds to recapitalize struggling banks exposed to the collapsed domestic construction and real estate sectors."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$1.434 trillion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 15 $1.454 trillion (2011 est.) $1.448 trillion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$1.352 trillion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"-1.4% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 204 0.4% (2011 est.) -0.3% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$31,100 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 46 $31,500 (2011 est.) $31,400 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"18.6% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 82 17.5% of GDP (2011 est.) 18.3% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 59.3% government consumption: 20.2% investment in fixed capital: 19.2% investment in inventories: 0.6% exports of goods and services: 32.7% imports of goods and services: -31.9% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 3.1% industry: 26.3% services: 70.7% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"grain, vegetables, olives, wine grapes, sugar beets, citrus;
