{"middle east":{"saudi arabia":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to Islam's two holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina. The king's official title is the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi state was founded in 1932 by ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman Al SAUD (Ibn Saud) after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian Peninsula. One of his male descendants rules the country today, as required by the country's 1992 Basic Law. King ABDALLAH bin Abd al-Aziz ascended to the throne in 2005. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. The continuing presence of foreign troops on Saudi soil after the liberation of Kuwait became a source of tension between the royal family and the public until all operational US troops left the country in 2003. Major terrorist attacks in May and November 2003 spurred a strong on-going campaign against domestic terrorism and extremism. King ABDALLAH has continued the cautious reform program begun when he was crown prince. The king instituted an interfaith dialogue initiative in 2008 to encourage religious tolerance on a global level; in 2009, he reshuffled the cabinet, which led to more moderates holding ministerial and judicial positions, and appointed the first female to the cabinet. The 2010-12 uprisings across Middle Eastern and North African countries sparked modest incidents in Saudi cities, predominantly by Shia demonstrators calling for the release of detainees and the withdrawal from Bahrain of the Gulf Cooperation Council's Peninsula Shield Force. Protests in general were met by a strong police presence, with some arrests, but not the level of bloodshed seen in protests elsewhere in the region. In response to the unrest, King ABDALLAH in February and March 2011 announced a series of benefits to Saudi citizens including funds to build affordable housing, salary increases for government workers, and unemployment entitlements. To promote increased political participation, the government held elections nationwide in September 2011 for half the members of 285 municipal councils. Also in September, the king announced that women will be allowed to run for and vote in future municipal elections - first held in 2005 - and serve as full members of the advisory Consultative Council. During 2012, Shia protests increased in violence, while peaceful Sunni protests expanded. The country remains a leading producer of oil and natural gas and holds about 17% of the world's proven oil reserves. The government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification, particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the WTO in December 2005, and promotes foreign investment in the kingdom. A burgeoning population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on petroleum output and prices are ongoing governmental concerns."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"25 00 N, 45 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Middle East"},"area":{"value":"total: 2,149,690 sq km country comparison to the world: 13 land: 2,149,690 sq km water: 0 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly more than one-fifth the size of the US"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 4,431 km border countries: Iraq 814 km, Jordan 744 km, Kuwait 222 km, Oman 676 km, Qatar 60 km, UAE 457 km, Yemen 1,458 km"},"coastline":{"value":"2,640 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm contiguous zone: 18 nm continental shelf: not specified"},"climate":{"value":"harsh, dry desert with great temperature extremes"},"terrain":{"value":"mostly uninhabited, sandy desert"},"elevation extremes":{"value":"lowest point: Persian Gulf 0 m highest point: Jabal Sawda' 3,133 m"},"natural resources":{"value":"petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, gold, copper"},"land use":{"value":"arable land: 1.45% permanent crops: 0.11% other: 98.44% (2011)"},"irrigated land":{"value":"16,200 sq km (2004)"},"total renewable water resources":{"value":"2.4 cu km (2011)"},"freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"value":"total: 23.67 cu km/yr (9%/3%/88%) per capita: 928.1 cu m/yr (2006)"},"natural hazards":{"value":"frequent sand and dust storms volcanism: despite many volcanic formations, there has been little activity in the past few centuries;

Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals. Diversification efforts are focusing on power generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration, and petrochemical sectors. Over 5 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and service sectors, while Riyadh is struggling to reduce unemployment among its own nationals. Saudi officials are particularly focused on employing its large youth population, which generally lacks the education and technical skills the private sector needs. Riyadh has substantially boosted spending on job training and education, most recently with the opening of the King Abdallah University of Science and Technology - Saudi Arabia's first co-educational university. As part of its effort to attract foreign investment, Saudi Arabia acceded to the WTO in 2005.
