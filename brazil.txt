By far the largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil underwent more than a half century of populist and military government until 1985, when the military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian rulers. Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development of its interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor pool, it is today South America's leading economic power and a regional leader, one of the first in the area to begin an economic recovery.

Brasilia has not taken full advantage of its large working-age population to develop its human capital and strengthen its social and economic institutions. The current favorable age structure will begin to shift around 2025, with the labor force shrinking and the elderly starting to compose an increasing share of the total population. Well-funded public pensions have nearly wiped out poverty among the elderly, but limited social spending on children has restricted investment in education - a primary means of escaping poverty. Brazil's poverty and income inequality levels remain high despite improvements in the 2000s and continue to disproportionately affect the Northeast, North, and Center-West, women, and black, mixed race, and indigenous populations. Disparities in opportunities foster social exclusion and contribute to Brazil's high crime rate, particularly violent crime in cities and favelas. Brazil has traditionally been a net recipient of immigrants, with its southeast being the prime destination. After the importation of African slaves was outlawed in the mid-19th century, Brazil sought Europeans (Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards, and Germans) and later Asians (Japanese) to work in agriculture, especially coffee cultivation. Recent immigrants come mainly from Argentina, Chile, and Andean countries (many are unskilled illegal migrants) or are returning Brazilian nationals. Since Brazil's economic downturn in the 1980s, emigration to the United States, Europe, and Japan has been rising but is negligible relative to Brazil's total population. The majority of these emigrants are well-educated and middle-class. Fewer Brazilian peasants are emigrating to neighboring countries to take up agricultural work."},"population":{"value":"201,009,622 (July 2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 6"},"age structure":{"value":"0-14 years: 24.2% (male 24,814,906/female 23,879,697) 15-24 years: 16.7% (male 16,982,245/female 16,513,161) 25-54 years: 43.6% (male 43,396,927/female 44,170,680) 55-64 years: 8.2% (male 7,792,041/female 8,736,359) 65 years and over: 7.3% (male 6,250,580/female 8,473,026) (2013 est.) population pyramid:"},"dependency ratios":{"value":"total dependency ratio: 46.2 % youth dependency ratio: 35.2 % elderly dependency ratio: 11 % potential support ratio: 9.1 (2013)"},"median age":{"value":"total: 30.3 years male: 29.5 years female: 31.1 years (2013 est.)"},"population growth rate":{"value":"0.83% (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 133"},"birth rate":{"value":"14.97 births/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 133"},"death rate":{"value":"6.51 deaths/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 152"},"net migration rate":{"value":"-0.17 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 116"},"urbanization":{"value":"urban population: 87% of total population (2010) rate of urbanization: 1.1% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"major urban areas - population":{"value":"Sao Paulo 19.96 million;

Since 2003, Brazil has steadily improved its macroeconomic stability, building up foreign reserves, and reducing its debt profile by shifting its debt burden toward real denominated and domestically held instruments. In 2008, Brazil became a net external creditor and two ratings agencies awarded investment grade status to its debt. After strong growth in 2007 and 2008, the onset of the global financial crisis hit Brazil in 2008. Brazil experienced two quarters of recession, as global demand for Brazil's commodity-based exports dwindled and external credit dried up. However, Brazil was one of the first emerging markets to begin a recovery. In 2010, consumer and investor confidence revived and GDP growth reached 7.5%, the highest growth rate in the past 25 years. Rising inflation led the authorities to take measures to cool the economy; these actions and the deteriorating international economic situation slowed growth to 2.7% in 2011, and 1.3% in 2012. Unemployment is at historic lows and Brazil's traditionally high level of income inequality has declined for each of the last 14 years. Brazil's historically high interest rates have made it an attractive destination for foreign investors. Large capital inflows over the past several years have contributed to the appreciation of the currency, hurting the competitiveness of Brazilian manufacturing and leading the government to intervene in foreign exchange markets and raise taxes on some foreign capital inflows. President Dilma ROUSSEFF has retained the previous administration's commitment to inflation targeting by the central bank, a floating exchange rate, and fiscal restraint. In an effort to boost growth, in 2012 the administration implemented a somewhat more expansionary monetary policy that has failed to stimulate much growth."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$2.394 trillion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 8 $2.374 trillion (2011 est.) $2.31 trillion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$2.396 trillion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
