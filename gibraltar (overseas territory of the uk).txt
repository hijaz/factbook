{"europe":{"gibraltar (overseas territory of the uk)":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to Great Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British garrison was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum held in 1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK led to Spain closing the border and severing all communication links. Between 1997 and 2002, the UK and Spain held a series of talks on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar. In response to these talks, the Gibraltar Government called a referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since late 2004, Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar have held tripartite talks with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that affect the local population, and work continues on cooperation agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services; communications and maritime security; policy, legal and customs services; environmental protection; and education and visa services. Throughout 2009, a dispute over Gibraltar's claim to territorial waters extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols. A new noncolonial constitution came into effect in 2007, and the European Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar's right to regulate its own tax regime in December 2008. The UK retains responsibility for defense, foreign relations, internal security, and financial stability."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Southwestern Europe, bordering the Strait of Gibraltar, which links the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southern coast of Spain"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"36 08 N, 5 21 W"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 6.5 sq km country comparison to the world: 243 land: 6.5 sq km water: 0 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"more than 10 times the size of The National Mall in Washington, D.C."},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 1.2 km border countries: Spain 1.2 km"},"coastline":{"value":"12 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 3 nm"},"climate":{"value":"Mediterranean with mild winters and warm summers"},"terrain":{"value":"a narrow coastal lowland borders the Rock of Gibraltar"},"elevation extremes":{"value":"lowest point: Mediterranean Sea 0 m highest point: Rock of Gibraltar 426 m"},"natural resources":{"value":"none"},"land use":{"value":"arable land: 0% permanent crops: 0% other: 100% (2011)"},"irrigated land":{"value":"NA"},"natural hazards":{"value":"NA"},"environment - current issues":{"value":"limited natural freshwater resources: large concrete or natural rock water catchments collect rainwater (no longer used for drinking water) and adequate desalination plant"},"geography - note":{"value":"strategic location on Strait of Gibraltar that links the North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea"}},"people and society":{"nationality":{"value":"noun: Gibraltarian(s) adjective: Gibraltar"},"ethnic groups":{"value":"Spanish, Italian, English, Maltese, Portuguese, German, North Africans"},"languages":{"value":"English (used in schools and for official purposes), Spanish, Italian, Portuguese"},"religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 78.1%, Church of England 7%, other Christian 3.2%, Muslim 4%, Jewish 2.1%, Hindu 1.8%, other or unspecified 0.9%, none 2.9% (2001 census)"},"population":{"value":"29,111 (July 2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 219"},"age structure":{"value":"0-14 years: 20.1% (male 3,013/female 2,845) 15-24 years: 16.4% (male 2,481/female 2,284) 25-54 years: 37.7% (male 5,493/female 5,493) 55-64 years: 11.2% (male 1,580/female 1,667) 65 years and over: 14.6% (male 2,081/female 2,174) (2013 est.) population pyramid:"},"median age":{"value":"total: 33.8 years male: 32.9 years female: 34.8 years (2013 est.)"},"population growth rate":{"value":"0.26% (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 172"},"birth rate":{"value":"14.19 births/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 140"},"death rate":{"value":"8.28 deaths/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 91"},"net migration rate":{"value":"-3.3 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 179"},"urbanization":{"value":"urban population: 100% of total population (2010) rate of urbanization: 0.2% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"sex ratio":{"value":"at birth: 1.07 male(s)/female 0-14 years: 1.06 male(s)/female 15-24 years: 1.09 male(s)/female 25-54 years: 0.99 male(s)/female 55-64 years: 1 male(s)/female 65 years and over: 0.95 male(s)/female total population: 1.01 male(s)/female (2013 est.)"},"infant mortality rate":{"value":"total: 6.42 deaths/1,000 live births country comparison to the world: 166 male: 7.14 deaths/1,000 live births female: 5.64 deaths/1,000 live births (2013 est.)"},"life expectancy at birth":{"value":"total population: 78.98 years country comparison to the world: 47 male: 76.13 years female: 82.03 years (2013 est.)"},"total fertility rate":{"value":"1.93 children born/woman (2013 est.) country comparison to the world: 136"},"hiv/aids - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"hiv/aids - people living with hiv/aids":{"value":"NA"},"hiv/aids - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"education expenditures":{"value":"NA"},"literacy":{"value":"definition: NA total population: above 80% male: NA female: NA"}},"government":{"country name":{"value":"conventional long form: none conventional short form: Gibraltar"},"dependency status":{"value":"overseas territory of the UK"},"government type":{"value":"NA"},"capital":{"value":"name: Gibraltar geographic coordinates: 36 08 N, 5 21 W time difference: UTC+1 (6 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time) daylight saving time: +1hr, begins last Sunday in March;

The financial sector, tourism, and the shipping sector contribute 30%, 30%, and 25%, respectively, of GDP. Telecommunications, e-commerce, and e-gaming account for the remaining 15%.
