{"europe":{"norway":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994. Conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In 1949, neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU. Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities, maintaining the country's extensive social safety net with an aging population, and preserving economic competitiveness."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Northern Europe, bordering the North Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Sweden"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"62 00 N, 10 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 323,802 sq km country comparison to the world: 68 land: 304,282 sq km water: 19,520 sq km"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly larger than New Mexico"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 2,542 km border countries: Finland 727 km, Sweden 1,619 km, Russia 196 km"},"coastline":{"value":"25,148 km (includes mainland 2,650 km, as well as long fjords, numerous small islands, and minor indentations 22,498 km;

Norway is the world's third-largest natural gas exporter; and seventh largest oil exporter, making one of its largest offshore oil finds in 2011. Norway opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994; nonetheless, as a member of the European Economic Area, it contributes sizably to the EU budget. In anticipation of eventual declines in oil and gas production, Norway saves state revenue from the petroleum sector in the world's second largest sovereign wealth fund, valued at over $700 billion in January 2013 and uses the fund''s return to help finance public expenses. After solid GDP growth in 2004-07, the economy slowed in 2008, and contracted in 2009, before returning to positive growth in 2010-12, however, the government budget is set to remain in surplus."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$281.7 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 45 $273.5 billion (2011 est.) $269.9 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$501.1 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
