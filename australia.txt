{"australia-oceania":{"australia":{"introduction":{"background":{"value":"Prehistoric settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia at least 40,000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century. No formal territorial claims were made until 1770, when Capt. James COOK took possession of the east coast in the name of Great Britain (all of Australia was claimed as British territory in 1829 with the creation of the colony of Western Australia). Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the Allied effort in World Wars I and II. In recent decades, Australia has become an internationally competitive, advanced market economy due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s and its location in one of the fastest growing regions of the world economy. Long-term concerns include aging of the population, pressure on infrastructure, and environmental issues such as floods, droughts, and bushfires. Australia is the driest inhabited continent on earth, making it particularly vulnerable to the challenges of climate change. Australia is home to 10 per cent of the world's biodiversity, and a great number of its flora and fauna exist nowhere else in the world. In January 2013, Australia assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2013-14 term."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Oceania, continent between the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"27 00 S, 133 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Oceania"},"area":{"value":"total: 7,741,220 sq km country comparison to the world: 6 land: 7,682,300 sq km water: 58,920 sq km note: includes Lord Howe Island and Macquarie Island"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than the US contiguous 48 states"},"land boundaries":{"value":"0 km"},"coastline":{"value":"25,760 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 12 nm contiguous zone: 24 nm exclusive economic zone: 200 nm continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"climate":{"value":"generally arid to semiarid;

By 2012, Australia had experienced more than 20 years of continued economic growth, averaging 3.5% a year. Demand for resources and energy from Asia and especially China has grown rapidly, creating a channel for resources investments and growth in commodity exports. The high Australian dollar has hurt the manufacturing sector, while the services sector is the largest part of the Australian economy, accounting for about 70% of GDP and 75% of jobs. Australia was comparatively unaffected by the global financial crisis as the banking system has remained strong and inflation is under control. Australia has benefited from a dramatic surge in its terms of trade in recent years, stemming from rising global commodity prices. Australia is a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food. Australia's abundant and diverse natural resources attract high levels of foreign investment and include extensive reserves of coal, iron, copper, gold, natural gas, uranium, and renewable energy sources. A series of major investments, such as the US$40 billion Gorgon Liquid Natural Gas project, will significantly expand the resources sector. Australia is an open market with minimal restrictions on imports of goods and services. The process of opening up has increased productivity, stimulated growth, and made the economy more flexible and dynamic. Australia plays an active role in the World Trade Organization, APEC, the G20, and other trade forums. Australia has bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and the US, has a regional FTA with ASEAN and New Zealand, is negotiating agreements with China, India, Indonesia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, as well as with its Pacific neighbors and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and is also working on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement with Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US, and Vietnam."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$986.7 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 19 $952.6 billion (2011 est.) $930 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$1.542 trillion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"3.6% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 94 2.4% (2011 est.) 2.6% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$43,300 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 21 $42,400 (2011 est.) $41,900 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"25.2% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 46 25.1% of GDP (2011 est.) 24.1% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 54.9% government consumption: 18.2% investment in fixed capital: 28.5% investment in inventories: 0.4% exports of goods and services: 20.1% imports of goods and services: -22% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 3.9% industry: 27.2% services: 68.9% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"wheat, barley, sugarcane, fruits;
