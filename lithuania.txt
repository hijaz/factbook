By the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest state in Europe. An alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into a union through the person of a common ruler. In 1569, Lithuania and Poland formally united into a single dual state, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This entity survived until 1795 when its remnants were partitioned by surrounding countries. Lithuania regained its independence following World War I but was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many other countries. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence, but Moscow did not recognize this proclamation until September of 1991 (following the abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993. Lithuania subsequently restructured its economy for integration into Western European institutions; it joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Eastern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, between Latvia and Russia"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"56 00 N, 24 00 E"},"map references":{"value":"Europe"},"area":{"value":"total: 65,300 sq km country comparison to the world: 123 land: 62,680 sq km water: 2,620 sq km"},"area -
