Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country lived beyond its means, maintaining a bloated public service and accumulating a large foreign debt. Subsequent reforms, including the sale of state assets, the strengthening of economic management, the encouragement of tourism, and a debt restructuring agreement, have rekindled investment and growth."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$183.2 million (2005 est.) country comparison to the world: 220"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$183.2 million (2005 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"0.1% (2005 est.) country comparison to the world: 177"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$9,100 (2005 est.) country comparison to the world: 121"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 5.1% industry: 12.7% services: 82.1% (2010 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"copra, citrus, pineapples, tomatoes, beans, pawpaws, bananas, yams, taro, coffee;
