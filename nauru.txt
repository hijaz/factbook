Few other resources exist, with most necessities being imported, mainly from Australia, its former occupier and later major source of support. In 2005 an Australian company entered into an agreement to exploit remaining supplies. Primary reserves of phosphates were exhausted and mining ceased in 2006, but mining of a deeper layer of \"secondary phosphate\" in the interior of the island began the following year. The secondary phosphate deposits may last another 30 years. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems. In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate deposits, substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru's economic future. As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds, the government faced virtual bankruptcy. To cut costs the government has frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments. Nauru lost further revenue in 2008 with the closure of Australia''s refugee processing center, making it almost totally dependent on food imports and foreign aid. Housing, hospitals, and other capital plant are deteriorating. The cost to Australia of keeping the government and economy afloat continues to climb. Few comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist with estimates of Nauru''s GDP varying widely."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$60 million (2005 est.) country comparison to the world: 224"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$NA"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"NA%"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$5,000 (2005 est.) country comparison to the world: 157"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 6.1% industry: 33% services: 60.8% (2009 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"coconuts"},"industries":{"value":"phosphate mining, offshore banking, coconut products"},"industrial production growth rate":{"value":"NA%"},"labor force - by occupation":{"value":"note: employed in mining phosphates, public administration, education, and transportation"},"unemployment rate":{"value":"90% (2004 est.) country comparison to the world: 201"},"population below poverty line":{"value":"NA%"},"household income or consumption by percentage share":{"value":"lowest 10%: NA% highest 10%: NA%"},"budget":{"value":"revenues: $13.5 million expenditures: $13.5 million (2005)"},"fiscal year":{"value":"1 July - 30 June"},"inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"value":"NA% (2011 est.)"},"exports":{"value":"$64,000 (2005 est.) country comparison to the world: 220"},"exports - commodities":{"value":"phosphates"},"imports":{"value":"$20 million (2004 est.) country comparison to the world: 220"},"imports - commodities":{"value":"food, fuel, manufactures, building materials, machinery"},"debt - external":{"value":"$33.3 million (2004 est.) country comparison to the world: 196"},"exchange rates":{"value":"Australian dollars (AUD) per US dollar - 0.97 (2012) 0.97 (2011 est.) 1.09 (2010) 1.28 (2009) 1.21 (2008)"}},"energy":{"electricity - production":{"value":"35 million kWh (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 209"},"electricity - consumption":{"value":"32.55 million kWh (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 209"},"electricity - exports":{"value":"0 kWh (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 113"},"electricity - imports":{"value":"0 kWh (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 114"},"electricity - installed generating capacity":{"value":"1,000 kW (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 208"},"electricity - from fossil fuels":{"value":"100% of total installed capacity (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 27"},"electricity - from nuclear fuels":{"value":"0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 153"},"electricity - from hydroelectric plants":{"value":"0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 189"},"electricity - from other renewable sources":{"value":"0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 107"},"crude oil - production":{"value":"0 bbl/day (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 200"},"crude oil - exports":{"value":"0 bbl/day (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 165"},"crude oil - imports":{"value":"0 bbl/day (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 106"},"crude oil - proved reserves":{"value":"0 bbl (1 January 2013 es) country comparison to the world: 172"},"refined petroleum products - production":{"value":"0 bbl/day (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 118"},"refined petroleum products - consumption":{"value":"1,000 bbl/day (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 200"},"refined petroleum products - exports":{"value":"0 bbl/day (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 204"},"refined petroleum products - imports":{"value":"1,075 bbl/day (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 193"},"natural gas - production":{"value":"0 cu m (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 176"},"natural gas - consumption":{"value":"0 cu m (2010 est.) country comparison to the world: 181"},"natural gas - exports":{"value":"0 cu m (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 157"},"natural gas - imports":{"value":"0 cu m (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 109"},"natural gas - proved reserves":{"value":"0 cu m (1 January 2013 es) country comparison to the world: 179"},"carbon dioxide emissions from consumption of energy":{"value":"168,800 Mt (2011 est.) country comparison to the world: 195"}},"communications":{"telephones - main lines in use":{"value":"1,900 (2009) country comparison to the world: 219"},"telephones - mobile cellular":{"value":"6,800 (2012) country comparison to the world: 213"},"telephone system":{"value":"general assessment: adequate local and international radiotelephone communication provided via Australian facilities international: country code - 674;
