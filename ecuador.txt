Quito became a seat of Spanish colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence between 1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of the \"Republic of the Equator.\" Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian governance in 2004, the period was marred by political instability. Protests in Quito contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of Ecuador's last four democratically elected presidents. In late 2008, voters approved a new constitution, Ecuador's 20th since gaining independence. General elections were held in February 2013, and voters re-elected President Rafael CORREA."}},"geography":{"location":{"value":"Western South America, bordering the Pacific Ocean at the Equator, between Colombia and Peru"},"geographic coordinates":{"value":"2 00 S, 77 30 W"},"map references":{"value":"South America"},"area":{"value":"total: 283,561 sq km country comparison to the world: 74 land: 276,841 sq km water: 6,720 sq km note: includes Galapagos Islands"},"area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than Nevada"},"land boundaries":{"value":"total: 2,010 km border countries: Colombia 590 km, Peru 1,420 km"},"coastline":{"value":"2,237 km"},"maritime claims":{"value":"territorial sea: 200 nm continental shelf: 100 nm from 2,500-m isobath"},"climate":{"value":"tropical along coast, becoming cooler inland at higher elevations; tropical in Amazonian jungle lowlands"},"terrain":{"value":"coastal plain (costa), inter-Andean central highlands (sierra), and flat to rolling eastern jungle (oriente)"},"elevation extremes":{"value":"lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m highest point: Chimborazo 6,267 m note: due to the fact that the earth is not a perfect sphere and has an equatorial bulge, the highest point on the planet furthest from its center is Mount Chimborazo not Mount Everest, which is merely the highest peak above sea-level"},"natural resources":{"value":"petroleum, fish, timber, hydropower"},"land use":{"value":"arable land: 4.51% permanent crops: 5.38% other: 90.11% (2011)"},"irrigated land":{"value":"8,534 sq km (2003)"},"total renewable water resources":{"value":"424.4 cu km (2011)"},"freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"value":"total: 9.92 cu km/yr (13%/6%/81%) per capita: 716.1 cu m/yr (2005)"},"natural hazards":{"value":"frequent earthquakes; landslides; volcanic activity; floods; periodic droughts volcanism: volcanic activity concentrated along the Andes Mountains; Sangay (elev. 5,230 m), which erupted in 2010, is mainland Ecuador's most active volcano; other historically active volcanoes in the Andes include Antisana, Cayambe, Chacana, Cotopaxi, Guagua Pichincha, Reventador, Sumaco, and Tungurahua; Fernandina (elev. 1,476 m), a shield volcano that last erupted in 2009, is the most active of the many Galapagos volcanoes; other historically active Galapagos volcanoes include Wolf, Sierra Negra, Cerro Azul, Pinta, Marchena, and Santiago"},"environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation; soil erosion; desertification; water pollution; pollution from oil production wastes in ecologically sensitive areas of the Amazon Basin and Galapagos Islands"},"environment - international agreements":{"value":"party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements"},"geography - note":{"value":"Cotopaxi in Andes is highest active volcano in world"}},"people and society":{"nationality":{"value":"noun: Ecuadorian(s) adjective: Ecuadorian"},"ethnic groups":{"value":"mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white) 71.9%, Montubio 7.4%, Afroecuadorian 7.2%, Amerindian 7%, white 6.1%, other 0.4% (2010 census)"},"languages":{"value":"Spanish (official), indigenous (Quechua, Shuar)"},"religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 95%, other 5%"},"demographic profile":{"value":"Ecuador's high poverty and income inequality most affect indigenous, mixed race, and rural populations.

Nevertheless, the conditional cash transfer program, which requires participants' children to attend school and have medical check-ups, has helped improve educational attainment and healthcare among poor children. Ecuador is stalled at above replacement level fertility and the population most likely will keep growing rather than stabilize. An estimated 2 to 3 million Ecuadorians live abroad, but increased unemployment in key receiving countries - Spain, the United States, and Italy - is slowing emigration and increasing the likelihood of returnees to Ecuador. The first large-scale emigration of Ecuadorians occurred between 1980 and 2000, when an economic crisis drove Ecuadorians from southern provinces to New York City, where they had trade contacts. A second, nationwide wave of emigration in the late 1990s was caused by another economic downturn, political instability, and a currency crisis. Spain was the logical destination because of its shared language and the wide availability of low-skilled, informal jobs at a time when increased border surveillance made illegal migration to the US difficult.

In 1999/2000, Ecuador's economy suffered from a banking crisis, with GDP contracting by 5.3% and poverty increasing significantly. In March 2000, the Congress approved a series of structural reforms that also provided for the adoption of the US dollar as legal tender. Dollarization stabilized the economy, and positive growth returned in the years that followed, helped by high oil prices, remittances, and increased non-traditional exports. From 2002-06 the economy grew an average of 4.3% per year, the highest five-year average in 25 years. After moderate growth in 2007, the economy reached a growth rate of 6.4% in 2008, buoyed by high global petroleum prices and increased public sector investment. President Rafael CORREA, who took office in January 2007, defaulted in December 2008 on Ecuador's sovereign debt, which, with a total face value of approximately US$3.2 billion, represented about 30% of Ecuador's public external debt. In May 2009, Ecuador bought back 91% of its \"defaulted\" bonds via an international reverse auction. Economic policies under the CORREA administration - for example, an announcement in late 2009 of its intention to terminate 13 bilateral investment treaties, including one with the United States - have generated economic uncertainty and discouraged private investment. The Ecuadorian economy slowed to 1% growth in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and to the sharp decline in world oil prices and remittance flows. Growth picked up to a 3.3% rate in 2010 and nearly 8% in 2011, before falling to 5% in 2012. China has become Ecuador's largest foreign lender since Quito defaulted in 2008, allowing the government to maintain a high rate of social spending; Ecuador contracted with the Chinese government for more than $9 billion in oil for cash and project loans as of December 2012."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$155.8 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 61 $148.4 billion (2011 est.) $137.4 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$80.93 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp -
