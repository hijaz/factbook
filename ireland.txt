A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched off several years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in independence from the UK for 26 southern counties; six northern (Ulster) counties remained part of the UK. In 1949, Ireland withdrew from the British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in 1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful unification of Ireland and have cooperated with Britain against terrorist groups. A peace settlement for Northern Ireland is gradually being implemented despite some difficulties.

Ireland was among the initial group of 12 EU nations that began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002. GDP growth averaged 6% in 1995-2007, but economic activity has dropped sharply since the onset of the world financial crisis, with GDP falling by over 3% in 2008, nearly 7% in 2009, and less than 1% in 2010. Ireland entered into a recession in 2008 for the first time in more than a decade, with the subsequent collapse of its domestic property and construction markets. Property prices rose more rapidly in Ireland in the decade up to 2007 than in any other developed economy. Since their 2007 peak, average house prices have fallen 47%. In the wake of the collapse of the construction sector and the downturn in consumer spending and business investment, the export sector, dominated by foreign multinationals, has become a key component of Ireland's economy. Agriculture, once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry and services. In 2008 the former COWEN government moved to guarantee all bank deposits, recapitalize the banking system, and establish partly-public venture capital funds in response to the country's economic downturn. In 2009, in continued efforts to stabilize the banking sector, the Irish Government established the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to acquire problem commercial property and development loans from Irish banks. Faced with sharply reduced revenues and a burgeoning budget deficit, the Irish Government introduced the first in a series of draconian budgets in 2009. In addition to across-the-board cuts in spending, the 2009 budget included wage reductions for all public servants. These measures were not sufficient. In 2010, the budget deficit reached 32.4% of GDP - the world's largest deficit, as a percentage of GDP - because of additional government support for the banking sector. In late 2010, the former COWEN government agreed to a $112 billion loan package from the EU and IMF to help Dublin further increase the capitalization of its banking sector and avoid defaulting on its sovereign debt. Since entering office in March 2011, the new KENNY government has intensified austerity measures to try to meet the deficit targets under Ireland's EU-IMF program. Ireland achieved moderate growth of 1.4% in 2011 and cut the budget deficit to 9.1% of GDP. Although the recovery slowed in 2012 because of weaker EU demand for Irish exports, Dublin managed to trim the deficit to about 8.5% of GDP."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$195.4 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 57 $193.6 billion (2011 est.) $190.8 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$210.4 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"0.9% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 172 1.4% (2011 est.) -0.8% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$42,600 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 23 $42,300 (2011 est.) $41,900 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"15.3% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 101 12.5% of GDP (2011 est.) 13% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 50.4% government consumption: 15.3% investment in fixed capital: 10.6% investment in inventories: 0.3% exports of goods and services: 107.8% imports of goods and services: -84.6% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 1.6% industry: 27.9% services: 70.5% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"barley, potatoes, wheat;
