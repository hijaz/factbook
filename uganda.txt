Uganda has never conducted a national minerals survey. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986, the government - with the support of foreign countries and international agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting production and export earnings. Since 1990 economic reforms ushered in an era of solid economic growth based on continued investment in infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports, lower inflation, better domestic security, and the return of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs. Uganda has received about $2 billion in multilateral and bilateral debt relief. In 2007 Uganda received $10 million for a Millennium Challenge Account Threshold Program. The global economic downturn hurt Uganda's exports; however, Uganda's GDP growth has largely recovered due to past reforms and sound management of the downturn. Oil revenues and taxes will become a larger source of government funding as oil comes on line in the next few years. Rising food and fuel prices in 2011 led to protests. Instability in South Sudan is a risk for the Ugandan economy because Uganda''s main export partner is Sudan, and Uganda is a key destination for Sudanese refugees. Unreliable power, high energy costs, inadequate transportation infrastructure, and corruption inhibit economic development and investor confidence."},"gdp (purchasing power parity)":{"value":"$51.27 billion (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 94 $49.98 billion (2011 est.) $46.86 billion (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gdp (official exchange rate)":{"value":"$21 billion (2012 est.)"},"gdp - real growth rate":{"value":"2.6% (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 115 6.7% (2011 est.) 5.6% (2010 est.)"},"gdp - per capita (ppp)":{"value":"$1,400 (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 205 $1,400 (2011 est.) $1,400 (2010 est.) note: data are in 2012 US dollars"},"gross national saving":{"value":"14.7% of GDP (2012 est.) country comparison to the world: 105 13.1% of GDP (2011 est.) 12.9% of GDP (2010 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by end use":{"value":"household consumption: 80.8% government consumption: 7.8% investment in fixed capital: 24.9% investment in inventories: 0.3% exports of goods and services: 22.3% imports of goods and services: -36.1% (2012 est.)"},"gdp - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"agriculture: 23.5% industry: 27.2% services: 49.3% (2012 est.)"},"agriculture - products":{"value":"coffee, tea, cotton, tobacco, cassava (tapioca), potatoes, corn, millet, pulses, cut flowers;
